# Magnetic Force Between Two Balls

You are given an array `position` of integers where each integer represents the position of a ball on a number line. You are also given an integer `m` representing the number of balls you need to place in the `position` array. The goal is to maximize the minimum magnetic force between any two balls placed.

The magnetic force between two balls placed at positions `x` and `y` is defined as the absolute difference between their positions, i.e., `|x - y|`.

**Input:**

1. An integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), the number of balls.
2. An array of integers `position` of length `n` (1 ≤ position[i] ≤ 10^9), where each integer represents the position of a ball.
3. An integer `m` (2 ≤ m ≤ n), the number of balls to place.

**Output:**

- An integer representing the maximum minimum magnetic force between any two balls placed.

**Example:**

**Input:**
```plaintext
5
1 2 8 4 9
3
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:**

In this example, you need to place 3 balls in the positions `[1, 2, 8, 4, 9]`. The largest minimum distance (magnetic force) between any two balls that you can achieve is `3`.

Here’s how to achieve this:

- Place one ball at position `1`.
- Place the second ball at position `4`.
- Place the third ball at position `9`.

The distances between the balls are `4 - 1 = 3` and `9 - 4 = 5`, so the minimum distance is `3`.


### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**

   The goal is to place `m` balls in `n` positions such that the minimum distance between any two balls is maximized. 

2. **Binary Search on the Minimum Distance**

   We use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum distance (`d`) that can be achieved between any two balls. The idea is to test various distances and see if it's feasible to place the balls with that minimum distance.

   **Binary Search Details:**
   - **Initial Range:**
     - `minF` (minimum possible distance) is initialized to `1`, because the smallest distance between two balls can be `1`.
     - `maxF` (maximum possible distance) is initialized to `position[n-1] - position[0]`, which is the difference between the farthest apart positions.

   - **Binary Search Loop:**
     - Compute `midF` as the middle value between `minF` and `maxF`.
     - Check if it's feasible to place `m` balls such that each pair of balls is at least `midF` distance apart.
     - If it’s possible to place the balls with `midF`, then there might be a larger minimum distance that works, so we adjust `minF` to `midF + 1`.
     - If it’s not possible to place the balls with `midF`, then reduce the distance by setting `maxF` to `midF - 1`.

3. **Feasibility Check**

   To determine if it's possible to place `m` balls with at least `midF` distance between any two balls, use a greedy approach:

   - **Place the First Ball:**
     - Place the first ball at the first position in the sorted array.
   
   - **Greedy Placement:**
     - For each subsequent position, place a ball only if the distance from the last placed ball is at least `midF`.
     - Count the number of balls placed. If it equals `m`, then it’s feasible to place the balls with at least `midF` distance.

   - **Check Completion:**
     - If you can place all `m` balls with at least `midF` distance, return `true`.
     - Otherwise, return `false`.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Sort the Positions:**
   - Sorting the positions allows us to easily test distances between consecutive positions and apply binary search effectively.

2. **Initialize Binary Search Parameters:**
   - Set `minF` to `1` and `maxF` to the difference between the maximum and minimum positions.

3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Calculate the midpoint distance (`midF`).
   - Use the `possible_to_place` function to check if placing balls with at least `midF` distance is feasible.
   - Adjust `minF` and `maxF` based on whether it was feasible.

4. **Feasibility Check (`possible_to_place`):**
   - Place the first ball at the first position.
   - Iterate through the positions to place the next balls, ensuring each is placed at least `midF` distance from the last placed ball.
   - Return `true` if all `m` balls are placed; otherwise, return `false`.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - After binary search completes, `result` will contain the maximum minimum distance where it is feasible to place the `m` balls.

### Example

Given `positions = [1, 2, 8, 4, 9]` and `m = 3`:

1. **Sort the Positions:**
   - Sorted positions: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 9]`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Initial search range: `minF = 1`, `maxF = 8`.
   - Check distances like `midF = 4, 6` through the binary search process.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - For each `midF`, check if you can place 3 balls with that minimum distance.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The largest distance that can be achieved is `3`.

This approach efficiently finds the maximum possible minimum distance by leveraging sorting and binary search combined with a greedy placement strategy.

### Code Explanation

The provided code aims to solve this problem using binary search. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sorting the Positions:**
   ```cpp
   sort(position.begin(), position.end());
   ```
   - The `position` array is sorted to facilitate the binary search on the distances between the balls.

2. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int minF = 1;
   int maxF = position[n-1] - position[0];
   ```
   - `minF` is initialized to `1`, representing the smallest possible magnetic force.
   - `maxF` is initialized to the difference between the maximum and minimum positions, representing the largest possible magnetic force.

3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   ```cpp
   int result = -1;
   while (minF <= maxF) {
       int midF = minF + (maxF - minF) / 2;
   ```
   - The loop performs a binary search to find the maximum possible minimum magnetic force. `midF` represents the current guess for the minimum magnetic force.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   ```cpp
   if (possible_to_place(midF, position, m)) {
       result = midF;
       minF = midF + 1;
   } else {
       maxF = midF - 1;
   }
   ```
   - The function `possible_to_place` checks if it’s possible to place `m` balls such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is at least `midF`.
   - If placing the balls is possible with `midF`, update `result` and try for a larger distance by setting `minF` to `midF + 1`.
   - If not possible, reduce the distance by setting `maxF` to `midF - 1`.

5. **Return Result:**
   ```cpp
   return result;
   ```
   - The result after the binary search loop is the maximum possible minimum magnetic force.

### Helper Function `possible_to_place`

1. **Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int p_previous = position[0];
   int c_balls = 1;
   ```
   - Start by placing the first ball at the first position (`position[0]`).
   - `c_balls` is initialized to `1` because the first ball is already placed.

2. **Placing Balls:**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i < position.size(); i++) {
       int p_current = position[i];
       if (p_current - p_previous >= midF) {
           c_balls++;
           p_previous = p_current;
       }
       if (c_balls == m) {
           break;
       }
   }
   ```
   - Iterate over the sorted positions and place a ball at position `i` if the distance from the last placed position is at least `midF`.
   - If `c_balls` reaches `m`, it means `m` balls can be placed with at least `midF` distance apart.

3. **Final Check:**
   ```cpp
   return c_balls == m;
   ```
   - Return `true` if `m` balls are placed successfully; otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:**
   - The sorting operation has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

2. **Binary Search:**
   - The binary search runs in \(O(\log D)\), where `D` is the maximum possible distance between the first and last position.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The `possible_to_place` function runs in \(O(n)\) as it iterates through the positions array.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n + n \log D) \]
which simplifies to:
\[ O(n \log n) \]
since \( \log D \) is generally smaller compared to \( \log n \) for large inputs.

This approach is efficient for large inputs due to the combination of sorting, binary search, and linear scanning.
