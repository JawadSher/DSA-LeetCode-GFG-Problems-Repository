<h1 align='center'>DYNAMIC - PROGRAMMING - PROBLEMS</h1>

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. DP is particularly useful when the problem involves overlapping subproblems, where the same subproblems are solved multiple times. By solving each subproblem just once and storing its solution (memoization), DP significantly reduces the computational cost and improves efficiency.

### Key Concepts:
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: When the problem can be divided into subproblems that are solved multiple times, dynamic programming ensures that each subproblem is solved once and its result is reused.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
- **Memoization** (Top-Down): This approach involves solving a problem recursively and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Tabulation** (Bottom-Up): This method solves the problem iteratively by filling a table from the base case up to the final solution.

### Common Types of DP Problems:
- **1D DP**: Problems where you solve for each state of a single dimension.
- **2D DP**: Problems that involve solving for each state across two dimensions (e.g., matrix problems).
- **Knapsack Problems**: These involve optimizing a value within certain constraints, often solved using DP.
- **Sequence Alignment**: Problems related to finding the longest common subsequence, shortest path, or palindromes.

### Real-World Applications:
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: A classic example where the solution is built from previous values.
- **Shortest Path Problems**: Algorithms like Floyd-Warshall and Bellman-Ford are used in dynamic programming for finding shortest paths.
- **Resource Allocation Problems**: Problems like knapsack and coin change fall under this category.

In this repository, you will find a variety of dynamic programming problems ranging from simple to complex, demonstrating how DP can be applied to different types of challenges. The problems are designed to enhance your understanding and provide you with the tools needed to approach optimization problems efficiently.
