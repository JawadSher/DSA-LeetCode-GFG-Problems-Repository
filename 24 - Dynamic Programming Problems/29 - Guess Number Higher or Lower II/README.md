### Problem Explanation
You are given an integer `n`, which represents a range of numbers from `1` to `n`. The goal of this problem is to guess a secret number chosen by the opponent from the range `[1, n]` using the minimum amount of "money" (i.e., the cost). The cost of each guess is equal to the number you guess.

**In simpler terms:**
- You are trying to guess a number in the range `[1, n]`.
- Each time you guess a number `i`, you have to pay the cost `i` (i.e., the value of the number you guessed).
- If your guess is too high, the range of potential numbers gets reduced to numbers less than `i`.
- If your guess is too low, the range gets reduced to numbers greater than `i`.
- You need to minimize the worst-case cost of guessing the secret number.

### Objective:
The objective is to figure out the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee that you will find the correct number, no matter which number the opponent chooses. This is called **minimizing the maximum cost**.

### Key Details:
1. **Input**: You are given an integer `n`, which represents the range `[1, n]`.
2. **Output**: You need to return the minimum amount of money required to guarantee finding the secret number.

### Explanation of the Problem

#### Game Process:
1. You start with a range of numbers `[1, n]`.
2. You guess a number `i` from this range.
   - If the secret number is less than `i`, the valid range becomes `[1, i-1]`.
   - If the secret number is greater than `i`, the valid range becomes `[i+1, n]`.
3. The cost of each guess is equal to the number you guess.

The challenge is to guess the number in such a way that even in the worst-case scenario, you minimize the amount of money you have to pay. You are allowed to guess any number in the range at each step.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough of the Problem:

Let’s walk through an example with `n = 10`.

### Example 1: `n = 10`
- The goal is to guess a number in the range `[1, 10]`.
- **Worst-case** means you want to minimize the highest cost you might incur during the process of guessing. For instance, if you guess number 5 first:
  - If the secret number is less than 5, the new range is `[1, 4]`.
  - If the secret number is greater than 5, the new range is `[6, 10]`.
  
At each guess, you incur a cost equal to the number you guessed. So the goal is to minimize the worst-case cost.

#### 1st Guess: Guess 6 (a middle number between 1 and 10)
- If the secret number is less than 6, the new range is `[1, 5]`.
- If the secret number is greater than 6, the new range is `[7, 10]`.

After guessing `6`, you need to check the sub-ranges `[1, 5]` and `[7, 10]`.

#### 2nd Guess: Guess 3 (a middle number between 1 and 5)
- If the secret number is less than 3, the range is `[1, 2]`.
- If the secret number is greater than 3, the range is `[4, 5]`.

#### 3rd Guess: Guess 4 (a middle number between 4 and 5)
- If the secret number is 4, you find it.
- If the secret number is 5, you find it.

#### Cost Calculation:
- Guess 6: You pay `6`.
- Guess 3: You pay `3`.
- Guess 4: You pay `4` (or 5 depending on the case).

Thus, the total cost in the worst-case scenario would be:
- First guess: 6
- Second guess: 3
- Third guess: 5 (assuming the opponent picked 5, the last guess)

The total cost for the worst case would be `6 + 3 + 5 = 16`.

### Example 2: `n = 2`
Now consider a smaller example, where `n = 2`.

- The numbers are `1` and `2`. 
- In this case, you can guess either number, but let's say you guess `1` first.
  - If the secret number is `1`, you win immediately.
  - If the secret number is `2`, you then guess `2`.

In the worst-case scenario (where the opponent picked `2`), you would guess `1` first, then `2`. The cost would be:
- First guess: 1
- Second guess: 2

So the total cost is `2`, which is the maximum cost you might incur.

### Key Observations:
1. **Base Case**: If there is only one number, you don’t need to guess, so the cost is `0`.
2. **Recursive Step**: For each range `[start, end]`, you can try any number `i` as a guess. If the number is too low, the valid range reduces to `[i+1, end]`. If the number is too high, the valid range reduces to `[start, i-1]`.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:
To solve this problem efficiently, we use dynamic programming (DP). We store the minimum cost for each subrange `[start, end]` in a 2D table `dp[start][end]`. The idea is to compute the minimum cost for each range `[start, end]` based on the cost of guessing each number in the range.

1. **DP Transition**: For a range `[start, end]`, we guess each number `i` between `start` and `end`, and calculate the cost as:
   - The cost of guessing `i`: `i` itself.
   - The maximum of the two subranges `[start, i-1]` and `[i+1, end]` (because we need to account for the worst case).

2. **Recursive Relation**: 
   - `dp[start][end] = min(i + max(dp[start][i-1], dp[i+1][end]))` for all `i` in the range `[start, end]`.

### Conclusion:
The problem asks you to find a strategy to minimize the worst-case cost of guessing the secret number, using dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem for large values of `n`. The key challenge is minimizing the maximum cost during the guessing process, ensuring you always make the best possible guess at each step.

## Recursive Approach (caused TLE)
The problem revolves around guessing the secret number in the range `[1, n]` with the least possible cost, where the cost of a guess is equal to the guessed number itself. The key idea is to minimize the worst-case cost of the guessing strategy, ensuring that no matter which number the opponent selects, the total cost will be minimized.

The recursive approach tries every possible guess for a given range and computes the worst-case cost for each guess. It uses the following steps:

1. **Base Case**: 
   - If the `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, no guessing is required, so the cost is `0`.
   - This case occurs when we have only one number to guess (e.g., `start == end`).

2. **Recursive Case**: 
   - For a given range `[start, end]`, the function tries each number `i` in the range as a possible guess. 
   - If we guess `i`, the cost is `i` itself.
   - Then, the problem is reduced to two subproblems:
     - One where the number is less than `i` (i.e., the range becomes `[start, i-1]`).
     - Another where the number is greater than `i` (i.e., the range becomes `[i+1, end]`).
   - For each guess `i`, the worst-case cost is the maximum of the costs of the two subproblems (`max(solve(start, i - 1), solve(i + 1, end))`).
   - The function then minimizes the total cost by selecting the guess `i` that results in the least worst-case cost.

### Example Explanation of Recursive Approach

Let’s walk through an example where `n = 4`. The range is `[1, 4]`.

- The goal is to find the minimum cost of guessing the secret number between `1` and `4` in the worst-case scenario.

#### Recursive Breakdown:

1. **Initial Call: `solve(1, 4)`**:
   We want to guess the secret number between `1` and `4`.

   - First, try guessing `1`:
     - The two subranges are `[1, 0]` (invalid, cost = 0) and `[2, 4]`.
     - The cost for guessing `1` is `1 + max(0, solve(2, 4))`.

   - Then, try guessing `2`:
     - The two subranges are `[1, 1]` (cost = 0) and `[3, 4]`.
     - The cost for guessing `2` is `2 + max(0, solve(3, 4))`.

   - Then, try guessing `3`:
     - The two subranges are `[1, 2]` and `[4, 4]`.
     - The cost for guessing `3` is `3 + max(solve(1, 2), 0)`.

   - Finally, try guessing `4`:
     - The two subranges are `[1, 3]` and `[5, 4]` (invalid, cost = 0).
     - The cost for guessing `4` is `4 + max(solve(1, 3), 0)`.

2. **Solving the subproblems** (recursive calls) will continue in a similar way, each time reducing the range and minimizing the worst-case cost at each level.

### Source Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win
    // in the range [start, end].
    int solve(int start, int end) {
        // Base case: If the start is greater than or equal to end, no money is needed.
        if (start >= end) return 0;

        // Initialize maxi to a very large value to store the minimum amount of money.
        int maxi = INT_MAX;

        // Try every number i in the range [start, end] as a possible guess.
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            // Calculate the cost of choosing i as the guess:
            // - i is the cost of guessing i.
            // - The two ranges are [start, i-1] and [i+1, end].
            // Take the maximum of the two subranges since we want to ensure the worst-case scenario.
            maxi = min(maxi, i + max(solve(start, i - 1), solve(i + 1, end)));
        }

        // Return the minimum money needed to guarantee a win for the range [start, end].
        return maxi;
    }
    
    // Wrapper function to start the process with the full range [1, n].
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        // Start solving from range [1, n]
        return solve(1, n);
    }
};
```

### Source Code Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win
    // in the range [start, end].
    int solve(int start, int end) {
        // Base case: If the start is greater than or equal to end, no money is needed.
        if (start >= end) return 0;
```

- **Line 1**: Defines the class `Solution` with a public access modifier.
- **Line 2-4**: This is the definition of the `solve()` function that calculates the minimum money needed to guarantee a win in a given range `[start, end]`. The goal of this function is to try all possible guesses and return the minimum worst-case cost. The function takes `start` and `end` as arguments, representing the range of numbers we're trying to guess.
  
- **Line 5**: **Base Case**: The function checks if the range `[start, end]` is invalid, meaning there is no valid number to guess, such as when `start >= end`. If that's the case, no guesses are needed, so the cost is `0`.

**Example**: 
- If `start = 5` and `end = 5`, we return `0` because there’s only one number, and no guessing is needed.

```cpp
        // Initialize maxi to a very large value to store the minimum amount of money.
        int maxi = INT_MAX;
```

- **Line 6**: Initializes `maxi` to `INT_MAX` (the largest possible integer value) to store the minimum worst-case cost across all guesses in the range `[start, end]`. Initially, we set it to a very large value to ensure that any valid cost will be smaller and replace `maxi`.

**Example**: 
- Before any guesses are made, `maxi` is `INT_MAX`.

```cpp
        // Try every number i in the range [start, end] as a possible guess.
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
```

- **Line 7-8**: This `for` loop iterates over all possible guesses `i` from `start` to `end`. For each guess, the function will calculate the cost of guessing that number and explore further possible guesses for the two resulting subranges.
  
**Example**: 
- If `start = 1` and `end = 4`, the loop will try guesses `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.

```cpp
            // Calculate the cost of choosing i as the guess:
            // - i is the cost of guessing i.
            // - The two ranges are [start, i-1] and [i+1, end].
            // Take the maximum of the two subranges since we want to ensure the worst-case scenario.
            maxi = min(maxi, i + max(solve(start, i - 1), solve(i + 1, end)));
```

- **Line 9-12**: Inside the loop, we calculate the cost of guessing `i`. The total cost for choosing `i` is:
  - The cost of guessing `i` itself, which is `i`.
  - We then evaluate the two resulting subranges after guessing `i`:
    - The first subrange is `[start, i - 1]`, i.e., the numbers less than `i`.
    - The second subrange is `[i + 1, end]`, i.e., the numbers greater than `i`.
  - For each subrange, we recursively call `solve()` to get the minimum money needed for that subrange. We use `max()` to ensure that we’re considering the worst-case scenario.
  - Finally, we use `min()` to update `maxi` with the smallest possible worst-case cost.
  
**Example**:
- If `start = 1`, `end = 4`, and we're considering guessing `i = 2`:
  - The cost of guessing `2` is `2`.
  - We then evaluate the two subranges:
    - `solve(1, 1)` for numbers less than `2`, which returns `0` (since `1` is the only number).
    - `solve(3, 4)` for numbers greater than `2`. It will recursively find the cost for this subrange.
  - The result of `solve(1, 1)` is `0`, and the result of `solve(3, 4)` is calculated in the next recursion.

```cpp
        }

        // Return the minimum money needed to guarantee a win for the range [start, end].
        return maxi;
    }
```

- **Line 13-15**: After evaluating all possible guesses in the range `[start, end]`, the function returns `maxi`, which holds the minimum worst-case cost. This value represents the minimum money needed to guarantee a win in the current range.

**Example**:
- For the range `[1, 4]`, after trying all guesses, the function will return the minimum worst-case cost that guarantees a win.

```cpp
    // Wrapper function to start the process with the full range [1, n].
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        // Start solving from range [1, n]
        return solve(1, n);
    }
};
```

- **Line 16-19**: The `getMoneyAmount()` function serves as a wrapper to start the process with the full range `[1, n]`. It simply calls `solve(1, n)`, where `1` is the starting number and `n` is the upper bound. This initiates the recursion from the full range of numbers.

**Example**:
- If `n = 10`, this will call `solve(1, 10)` to find the minimum cost of guessing a number in the range `[1, 10]`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s consider an example where `n = 4`. The goal is to determine the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win when guessing a number between `1` and `4`.

1. **Initial Call**: `solve(1, 4)`
   - Try guessing `1`, which results in:
     - Subranges `[1, 0]` (no guess needed, cost `0`) and `[2, 4]`.
     - The total cost is `1 + max(0, solve(2, 4))`.

2. **Next Call**: `solve(2, 4)`
   - Try guessing `2`, which results in:
     - Subranges `[2, 1]` (no guess needed, cost `0`) and `[3, 4]`.
     - The total cost is `2 + max(0, solve(3, 4))`.

3. **Next Call**: `solve(3, 4)`
   - Try guessing `3`, which results in:
     - Subranges `[3, 2]` (no guess needed, cost `0`) and `[4, 4]` (no guess needed, cost `0`).
     - The total cost is `3 + max(0, 0) = 3`.

After evaluating all possible guesses, the minimum worst-case cost is chosen, and the result is returned.

### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The function uses recursion to evaluate all possible subranges `[start, end]` for each guess in the range `[start, end]`. This results in `O(n^2)` unique subranges.
   - For each subrange, the function iterates through all possible guesses, which leads to an additional factor of `O(n)` for each subproblem.
   - Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n^3)** in the worst case.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity depends on the maximum recursion depth. Since the recursion depth can go up to `O(n)`, and each recursive call uses constant space (besides the call stack), the space complexity is **O(n)**.
   - Additionally, if memoization is added (not in the current code), it would require an `O(n^2)` table to store the results of subproblems.

## Top-Down Approach (DP)
The problem is essentially about determining the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win in a guessing game, where you have a range of numbers from `1` to `n`, and you need to find the optimal guessing strategy. The top-down approach uses **recursion** with **memoization** (caching results of subproblems) to avoid redundant calculations, improving the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.

#### Explanation of the Top-Down Approach:

1. **Recursion**: The idea is to try every number between the `start` and `end` as a guess and calculate the worst-case scenario for that guess. We want to minimize the maximum cost (since it's a guessing game and you are forced to pick the worst case).
   - If you guess a number `i` between `start` and `end`, two subproblems arise:
     1. One subproblem for the numbers smaller than `i`, i.e., the range `[start, i-1]`.
     2. Another subproblem for the numbers greater than `i`, i.e., the range `[i+1, end]`.
   - We recursively solve both subproblems and take the worst-case cost, then add the cost of guessing `i` itself.

2. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating the result for the same range multiple times, we store the computed values in a memoization table (a 2D array `dp[start][end]`). The value `dp[start][end]` holds the minimum cost required to guess the correct number in the range `[start, end]`.

3. **Base Case**: If the `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, no guessing is needed, so the cost is `0`.

4. **Recursion**: We recursively calculate the cost for each possible guess and use the results of previous subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. By storing the results in `dp`, the solution becomes efficient.

### Source Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Recursive function to calculate the minimum money required to guarantee a win
    // for the range [start, end]. We use dynamic programming to memoize the results.
    int solve(int start, int end, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        // Base case: If start is greater than or equal to end, no money is needed.
        if (start >= end) return 0;

        // Check if the result is already computed (memoized). If so, return it.
        if (dp[start][end] != -1) return dp[start][end];

        // Initialize maxi with a very large value to store the minimum amount of money.
        int maxi = INT_MAX;

        // Try every number i in the range [start, end] as a potential guess.
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            // Calculate the cost of guessing i:
            // - i is the cost of guessing i.
            // - The two ranges are [start, i-1] and [i+1, end].
            // We want to minimize the worst-case scenario, so we take the maximum
            // of the two subranges and add the cost of guessing i.
            maxi = min(maxi, i + max(solve(start, i - 1, dp), solve(i + 1, end, dp)));
        }

        // Memoize the result for this range [start, end] and return the calculated value.
        return dp[start][end] = maxi;
    }

    // Function to initiate the process for the full range [1, n]
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        // Create a 2D DP table to store the minimum money required for each range.
        // Initialize all values to -1 to signify that they are not computed yet.
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));

        // Start solving for the range [1, n]
        return solve(1, n, dp);
    }
};
```

### Source Code Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Recursive function to calculate the minimum money required to guarantee a win
    // for the range [start, end]. We use dynamic programming to memoize the results.
    int solve(int start, int end, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        // Base case: If start is greater than or equal to end, no money is needed.
        if (start >= end) return 0;
```
- **Line 1-4**: This is the definition of the `solve` function. It is a recursive function that calculates the minimum money required to guarantee a win in the range `[start, end]`.
  - The **base case** checks if the range is invalid (`start >= end`), in which case no guessing is needed, and it returns `0`.

```cpp
        // Check if the result is already computed (memoized). If so, return it.
        if (dp[start][end] != -1) return dp[start][end];
```
- **Line 5-6**: Here, we check if the result for the current range `[start, end]` is already computed and stored in `dp`. If the value is not `-1`, it means we have already calculated the minimum cost for this range, so we return the stored value.

```cpp
        // Initialize maxi with a very large value to store the minimum amount of money.
        int maxi = INT_MAX;
```
- **Line 7**: `maxi` is initialized to `INT_MAX` to store the minimum cost. We will later minimize this value as we evaluate each possible guess in the range.

```cpp
        // Try every number i in the range [start, end] as a potential guess.
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
```
- **Line 8-9**: The `for` loop iterates over all possible guesses `i` from `start` to `end`. We try every number in this range and calculate the cost of guessing that number.

```cpp
            // Calculate the cost of guessing i:
            // - i is the cost of guessing i.
            // - The two ranges are [start, i-1] and [i+1, end].
            // We want to minimize the worst-case scenario, so we take the maximum
            // of the two subranges and add the cost of guessing i.
            maxi = min(maxi, i + max(solve(start, i - 1, dp), solve(i + 1, end, dp)));
```
- **Line 10-13**: For each guess `i`, we calculate the total cost:
  - The cost of guessing `i` is `i`.
  - We recursively calculate the cost of the two subranges:
    - `solve(start, i-1, dp)` calculates the cost for the numbers less than `i`.
    - `solve(i+1, end, dp)` calculates the cost for the numbers greater than `i`.
  - We take the **maximum** of the two costs because we want to ensure that we account for the worst-case scenario.
  - We then update `maxi` by taking the **minimum** of `maxi` and the cost of guessing `i`.

```cpp
        }

        // Memoize the result for this range [start, end] and return the calculated value.
        return dp[start][end] = maxi;
    }
```
- **Line 14-16**: After evaluating all possible guesses in the range, we store the result `maxi` in `dp[start][end]` to memoize it and then return `maxi`.

```cpp
    // Function to initiate the process for the full range [1, n]
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        // Create a 2D DP table to store the minimum money required for each range.
        // Initialize all values to -1 to signify that they are not computed yet.
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));

        // Start solving for the range [1, n]
        return solve(1, n, dp);
    }
};
```
- **Line 17-20**: The `getMoneyAmount` function is the entry point. It initializes the **2D DP table** `dp` with size `(n+1) x (n+1)` and sets all values to `-1` to signify that they haven't been computed yet.
  - The function then calls `solve(1, n, dp)` to calculate the minimum money required for the full range `[1, n]`.



### Example Walkthrough

Let’s take an example where `n = 4`. We want to find the minimum money needed to guarantee a win when guessing a number between `1` and `4`.

1. **Initial Call**: `solve(1, 4, dp)`
   - Try guessing `1`, which results in:
     - Subranges `[1, 0]` (cost `0`) and `[2, 4]`.
     - The cost is `1 + max(0, solve(2, 4, dp))`.

2. **Next Call**: `solve(2, 4, dp)`
   - Try guessing `2`, which results in:
     - Subranges `[2, 1]` (cost `0`) and `[3, 4]`.
     - The cost is `2 + max(0, solve(3, 4, dp))`.

3. **Next Call**: `solve(3, 4, dp)`
   - Try guessing `3`, which results in:
     - Subranges `[3, 2]` (cost `0`) and `[4, 4]` (cost `0`).
     - The cost is `3 + max(0, 0) = 3`.

After trying all guesses, the result will be the minimum cost to guarantee a win.

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: The `solve()` function is called recursively for each subrange `[start, end]`. For each pair `(start, end)`, we iterate over all possible guesses, which can be up to `O(n)` guesses. 
   - In the worst case, we have to compute for `O(n^2)` subranges.
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n^3)**.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is determined by:
   - The memoization table `dp` which stores results for `O(n^2)` subranges, requiring **O(n^2)** space.
   - The maximum recursion depth is **O(n)**, which adds **O(n)** space for the call stack.
   - Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(n^2)**.

## Bottom-Up Approach (DP)

1. **Problem Recap**:
   You are given a range of numbers from `1` to `n`, and the goal is to guess a number such that the maximum money spent on guessing is minimized. In each guess, you pay the value of the number you're guessing, and based on the guess, the problem is reduced to two smaller subproblems:
   - A subproblem from the range `[start, i-1]` if the guess `i` is too high.
   - A subproblem from the range `[i+1, end]` if the guess `i` is too low.

2. **Goal**:
   The goal is to minimize the maximum money needed to guarantee a win by making the optimal guesses at each step. This is a dynamic programming problem where we need to calculate the minimum cost for all subranges `[start, end]` using a bottom-up approach.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   We use a 2D DP table where `dp[start][end]` stores the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win for the range `[start, end]`. The table is filled iteratively from smaller subproblems (ranges with fewer numbers) to larger ones (ranges with more numbers).

4. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each range `[start, end]`, we try each number `i` as a potential guess. The cost of guessing `i` is `i + max(dp[start][i-1], dp[i+1][end])`, where:
     - `i` is the cost of guessing `i`.
     - `dp[start][i-1]` is the cost for the subrange `[start, i-1]`.
     - `dp[i+1][end]` is the cost for the subrange `[i+1, end]`.
   - We aim to minimize the worst-case cost, so for each guess, we choose the one that minimizes the maximum cost between the two subranges.

5. **Final Result**:
   The value at `dp[1][n]` will give us the minimum money required to guarantee a win for the range `[1, n]`.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

Let’s take `n = 4` to explain this approach:

- We start by initializing the DP table `dp[start][end]` with `0` for all values.
- For small subranges, the DP values are trivially `0`, as no guessing is needed for ranges with just one number.
- For larger subranges, we compute the minimum cost by trying each number in the range as a guess.

#### **Step 1: Initialize DP Table**
We initialize a DP table of size `(n+2) x (n+2)` (i.e., `6 x 6` for `n = 4`), where all values are initially `0`.

```
DP Table (Initially):
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

#### **Step 2: Fill the Table Bottom-Up**
We fill the table starting from smaller subranges `[start, end]` and work our way up to the full range `[1, 4]`.

1. **For range [3, 4]**:
   - We try `i = 3` (cost = `3 + max(dp[3][2], dp[4][4]) = 3 + 0 = 3`).
   - We try `i = 4` (cost = `4 + max(dp[3][3], dp[5][4]) = 4 + 0 = 4`).
   - The minimum cost for this range is `3`.

2. **For range [2, 3]**:
   - We try `i = 2` (cost = `2 + max(dp[2][1], dp[3][3]) = 2 + 0 = 2`).
   - We try `i = 3` (cost = `3 + max(dp[2][2], dp[4][3]) = 3 + 0 = 3`).
   - The minimum cost for this range is `2`.

3. **For range [2, 4]**:
   - We try `i = 2` (cost = `2 + max(dp[2][1], dp[3][4]) = 2 + 3 = 5`).
   - We try `i = 3` (cost = `3 + max(dp[2][2], dp[4][4]) = 3 + 0 = 3`).
   - We try `i = 4` (cost = `4 + max(dp[2][3], dp[5][4]) = 4 + 2 = 6`).
   - The minimum cost for this range is `3`.

#### **Final DP Table**:
After filling the table, the final DP table will look like this:

```
DP Table (Final):
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3 0
0 0 0 2 3 0
0 0 0 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

The value at `dp[1][4]` is `4`, which is the minimum money required to guarantee a win for the range `[1, 4]`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the minimum money required to guarantee a win
    // for the range [1, n]. We use dynamic programming to solve the problem.
    int solve(int n) {
        // Create a 2D DP table (n+2 x n+2) initialized to 0.
        // dp[start][end] will store the minimum money required to guarantee a win in the range [start, end].
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 2, vector<int>(n + 2, 0));

        // Start filling the DP table from the bottom-up approach.
        // We iterate from n down to 1 for the 'start' index.
        for (int start = n; start >= 1; start--) {
            // For each 'start', we iterate from 'start' to 'n' for the 'end' index.
            for (int end = start; end <= n; end++) {
                // If start == end, it means there's only one number in the range,
                // so no money is needed (continue to the next iteration).
                if (start == end) continue;
                else {
                    // Initialize 'maxi' to a very large value to store the minimum money.
                    int maxi = INT_MAX;

                    // Try every number 'i' in the range [start, end] as a possible guess.
                    for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
                        // Calculate the cost of choosing 'i':
                        // - 'i' is the cost of guessing 'i'.
                        // - We then look at the two subranges: [start, i-1] and [i+1, end].
                        // The worst-case scenario is the maximum of the two subranges, 
                        // and we want to minimize the maximum cost.
                        maxi = min(maxi, i + max(dp[start][i - 1], dp[i + 1][end]));
                    }

                    // Store the result in the DP table for the range [start, end].
                    dp[start][end] = maxi;
                }
            }
        }

        // The result for the full range [1, n] is stored in dp[1][n].
        return dp[1][n];
    }
    
    // Wrapper function to start the process with the range [1, n].
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        // Call the solve function with the full range [1, n].
        return solve(n);
    }
};
```

### Source Code Explanation
We will take `n = 4` as an example to understand each part of the code. The goal is to calculate the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win in the range `[1, n]`.

### **Code Breakdown**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int n) {
        // Step 1: Initialize DP table with size (n+2) x (n+2) and all values set to 0
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 2, vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
```

- **Explanation**:
  - We initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+2) x (n+2)` because we need extra space to handle the boundaries of the range easily (from 1 to n). This array will be used to store the minimum cost for each subrange `[start, end]`.
  - The extra row and column (index `n+1`) are added for simplicity and to prevent out-of-bounds access when referencing `i-1` and `i+1`.

- **Example for `n = 4`**:
  ```cpp
  dp[0][0] = dp[0][1] = dp[0][2] = dp[0][3] = dp[0][4] = dp[1][0] = dp[1][1] = dp[1][2] = dp[1][3] = dp[1][4] = 0;
  dp[2][0] = dp[2][1] = dp[2][2] = dp[2][3] = dp[2][4] = 0;
  dp[3][0] = dp[3][1] = dp[3][2] = dp[3][3] = dp[3][4] = 0;
  dp[4][0] = dp[4][1] = dp[4][2] = dp[4][3] = dp[4][4] = 0;
  dp[5][0] = dp[5][1] = dp[5][2] = dp[5][3] = dp[5][4] = 0;
  ```
  This initializes a 6x6 DP table filled with `0`s.



```cpp
        // Step 2: Fill the DP table starting from smaller subranges
        for (int start = n; start >= 1; start--) {
            for (int end = start; end <= n; end++) {
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The outer loop iterates over the starting point `start` from `n` down to `1`, and the inner loop iterates over the ending point `end` from `start` to `n`. This ensures that we are considering all subranges `[start, end]` for every possible pair of `start` and `end`.
  
- **Example for `n = 4`**:
  - For `start = 4`, `end` will range from `4` to `4`.
  - For `start = 3`, `end` will range from `3` to `4`.
  - For `start = 2`, `end` will range from `2` to `4`.
  - For `start = 1`, `end` will range from `1` to `4`.



```cpp
                // Step 3: Skip the case where there's only one element in the range
                if (start == end) continue;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - If `start == end`, then there's only one number in the range. No guessing is needed, so we skip this iteration.

- **Example for `n = 4`**:
  - For `start = 3`, `end = 3`, we skip this iteration as there is only one number in the range `[3, 3]`.



```cpp
                // Step 4: Initialize a variable to track the minimum cost for this range
                int maxi = INT_MAX;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Here, `maxi` is initialized to the maximum possible value (`INT_MAX`). This variable will be used to store the minimum cost to guarantee a win for the current range `[start, end]`.

- **Example for `n = 4`**:
  - `maxi` is initialized to `INT_MAX`, which is essentially a very large value (used to ensure that any valid calculation of cost will be less than `INT_MAX`).



```cpp
                // Step 5: Try each number 'i' in the range [start, end] as a guess
                for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
```

- **Explanation**:
  - For each possible guess `i` in the range `[start, end]`, we calculate the cost of guessing `i`.

- **Example for `start = 1` and `end = 4`**:
  - For `start = 1`, `end = 4`, the loop will iterate over `i = 1, 2, 3, 4`.



```cpp
                    // Step 6: Calculate the cost for guessing 'i'
                    maxi = min(maxi, i + max(dp[start][i - 1], dp[i + 1][end]));
```

- **Explanation**:
  - We calculate the cost for guessing `i`:
    - The cost of guessing `i` is `i` itself.
    - After guessing `i`, we need to solve two subproblems:
      - The left subrange `[start, i-1]` (which is already stored in `dp[start][i-1]`).
      - The right subrange `[i+1, end]` (which is already stored in `dp[i+1][end]`).
    - The total cost is the guess `i` plus the worst-case cost (the maximum of the two subproblems).
  - We want to minimize this worst-case cost, so we update `maxi` with the minimum of its current value and the calculated cost.

- **Example for `start = 1` and `end = 4`**:
  - Suppose we try `i = 2`:
    - `dp[1][1] = 0` (left subproblem).
    - `dp[3][4] = 3` (right subproblem).
    - The cost for guessing `2` is `2 + max(0, 3) = 5`.
  - We continue trying other guesses in the range and calculate similar costs.



```cpp
                // Step 7: Store the result for the range [start, end]
                dp[start][end] = maxi;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - After trying all possible guesses for the range `[start, end]`, we store the minimum cost found (the value of `maxi`) in the DP table at `dp[start][end]`.

- **Example for `start = 1` and `end = 4`**:
  - After trying all possible guesses, we store the minimum value of `maxi` in `dp[1][4]`.



```cpp
        // Step 8: Return the result for the full range [1, n]
        return dp[1][n];
    }
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The final result, which is the minimum money required to guarantee a win for the full range `[1, n]`, is stored in `dp[1][n]`. This value is returned as the result.

- **Example for `n = 4`**:
  - The value at `dp[1][4]` will contain the answer, which is `4` for this case.


### **Example Output Explanation**:

For `n = 4`, the DP table will look like this after all iterations:

```
DP Table (Final):
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 4 0
0 0 0 2 3 0
0 0 0 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

- The result stored in `dp[1][4]` is `4`, which means the minimum money needed to guarantee a win in the range `[1, 4]` is `4`.


### **Time Complexity**:

- **Outer loops**:
  - The outer loop runs `n` times (for `start` from `n` down to `1`).
  - The inner loop runs at most `n` times (for `end` from `start` to `n`).

- **Inner loop for `i`**:
  - For each range `[start, end]`, the innermost loop iterates `end - start + 1` times, trying each number `i`.

Thus, the total time complexity is approximately `O(n^3)` because for each pair of `start` and `end`, we are trying all possible values of `i`.

### **Space Complexity**:

- The space complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the 2D DP table `dp`, which has a size of `(n+2) x (n+2)`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(n^2)`.

---

## Space Optimization (Not Possible)
In this problem, the space complexity is primarily driven by the need to store a 2D DP table (`dp[start][end]`) for all possible subranges `[start, end]`. Let’s explore in detail why space optimization is not possible or difficult to achieve in this case.

### **Understanding the DP Table Structure**

The problem essentially requires calculating the minimum cost to guarantee a win for every possible subrange `[start, end]` from `1` to `n`. To store these values, we use a 2D DP table where each entry `dp[start][end]` stores the result for a subrange `[start, end]`.

This structure demands that we keep track of all subranges, meaning we need a table where both dimensions are proportional to the size of the input (`n`).

### **Why Space Optimization is Challenging**

1. **Need to Store Results for Subranges**:
   - For each pair of start and end points (`start` and `end`), the value at `dp[start][end]` represents the minimum cost to guarantee a win for that range. This requires keeping track of all pairs of start and end points, which naturally leads to a 2D table.
   
   - The number of subranges grows quadratically with `n`, and so does the space complexity (i.e., `O(n^2)`).

2. **Dependence on Multiple Ranges**:
   - For each subrange `[start, end]`, we need to compute the minimum cost, which involves checking possible guesses (`i`) within that subrange. For each guess `i`, we consider the results for the two subranges:
     - `[start, i-1]`
     - `[i+1, end]`
   
   - This means that the result for a particular subrange depends on the results of other subranges, and thus we need to keep track of these intermediate results.

3. **No Overlapping Subranges**:
   - While many dynamic programming problems allow for optimizing space by reusing previous computations (e.g., in problems like Fibonacci or knapsack), this problem does not have a simple overlapping structure that allows us to only keep a few key results.
   - We must maintain results for all subranges, as each subrange can affect the result for other subranges, especially due to the recurrence relation:
     ```cpp
     dp[start][end] = min(dp[start][end], i + max(dp[start][i - 1], dp[i + 1][end]));
     ```

   - This recurrence requires that we preserve all subrange results to calculate the minimum money required for a range `[start, end]`. Hence, eliminating the 2D table (and reducing space) would mean losing the ability to efficiently access these results.

4. **No Immediate Reductions**:
   - If we consider trying to use a 1D array to optimize space, it would be very difficult to eliminate the second dimension. Each range `[start, end]` needs to be calculated independently, and using a single array to store results for all `start` and `end` pairs would not allow us to separate the computation for different ranges.

   - Even if we only used a 1D DP table for certain values (like only tracking results for one row or column at a time), we would still be left with many recalculations, which could negatively impact performance and would likely require us to use a recursive or more complicated approach.

5. **Effectiveness of Space Optimization**:
   - While some dynamic programming problems can be optimized in space (e.g., reducing from 2D DP to 1D by keeping track of only the previous row or column), the nature of this problem’s recurrence and the dependence between non-adjacent subranges (i.e., needing values from both left and right subranges) prevents such reductions.
   
   - For example, in problems where each subproblem only depends on the immediate previous or adjacent subproblems (like the Fibonacci sequence), space optimization is possible by only storing the last few results. However, in this problem, every range `[start, end]` can potentially depend on any other range, meaning we can’t simply discard earlier computations.

### **Space Complexity Conclusion**

Given that this problem requires keeping track of the results for all possible subranges and that the results for any subrange depend on two other subranges, the space complexity is inherently `O(n^2)`.

### **Possible Optimizations and Alternatives**

- **Reducing the Table Size**: While it's difficult to reduce the space complexity, in some variations of the problem, we might be able to reduce the space by observing certain properties, like using only a subset of the `dp` table at each stage. But in this problem, each subrange’s result is needed for the full solution.
  
- **State Compression**: For some problems, we might be able to use advanced techniques like state compression or memoization to optimize space. However, the structure of this problem does not lend itself easily to such optimizations.

### **In Summary**

Space optimization is not feasible in this problem because:
1. We need to store results for all subranges `[start, end]`, leading to an inherently quadratic space complexity (`O(n^2)`).
2. The recurrence relation requires the results of many non-adjacent subranges, making it difficult to discard earlier computations.
3. There is no obvious way to reduce the number of subranges to store, as each range’s result depends on multiple others.

Thus, the space complexity of `O(n^2)` is the most efficient possible approach for this problem, and attempting to reduce it further would result in significant loss of correctness or performance.
