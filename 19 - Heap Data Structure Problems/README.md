<h1 align='center'>HEAP - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>

The **Heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:  
- **Max-Heap**: The key of the parent node is always greater than or equal to the keys of its children.  
- **Min-Heap**: The key of the parent node is always less than or equal to the keys of its children.  

Heaps are primarily used in scenarios requiring **priority queues**, **sorting algorithms** (e.g., heap sort), and **efficient retrieval of minimum or maximum elements**. Due to their structure, heaps are highly efficient for operations like inserting, deleting, or finding elements in \( O(\log n) \) time.

This repository includes a variety of problems that involve:
- **Heap basics and STL implementations.**
- Common heap operations (e.g., finding kth largest/smallest elements).
- **Advanced applications** of heaps in algorithms like **merging sorted arrays**, **finding medians in a stream**, and **range problems** in multiple lists.

Each problem folder includes:
- **Problem statement and description.**
- Solutions with optimized approaches (when applicable).
- Links to the problem on **LeetCode** or **GeeksforGeeks**, along with relevant explanations.

Explore the **Heap Problems** section to gain insights into solving real-world challenges using heaps efficiently!
