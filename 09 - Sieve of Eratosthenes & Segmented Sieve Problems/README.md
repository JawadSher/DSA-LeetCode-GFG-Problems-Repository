<h1 align='center'>SIEVE - OF - ERATOSTHENES - ALGORITHM</h1>

This repository contains a collection of coding problems related to the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** algorithm, which is used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer `n`. The problems here span across both **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)** platforms, offering a variety of challenges that will help you gain a deeper understanding of this efficient algorithm for prime number generation.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes Overview:
The **Sieve of Eratosthenes** is one of the most efficient ways to identify all prime numbers up to a given number `n`. The basic idea is to iteratively mark the multiples of each prime number starting from `2`, and the remaining unmarked numbers are the primes.

### Repository Contents:
This repository provides problems that focus on both the algorithm and its various applications, including:

- **Prime Number Detection**
- **Prime Factorization**
- **Optimized Approaches** to the Sieve of Eratosthenes
- **Applications in Competitive Programming**
