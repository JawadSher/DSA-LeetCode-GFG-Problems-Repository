# Source Code Explanation
1.  **Include Directive:**
    
    ```cpp
    #include<iostream>
    
    ```
    
    -   This line includes the standard input/output stream library (`iostream`), which allows us to use functions like  `cout`  and  `cin`.
2.  **Namespace Declaration:**
    
    ```cpp
    using namespace std;
    
    ```
    
    -   This line declares that weâ€™re using the  `std`  namespace. It allows us to directly use standard library functions without prefixing them with  `std::`.
3.  **Function Definition:**
    
    ```cpp
    void duplicates(int arr[], int s) {
        // Function body
    }
    
    ```
    
    -   This defines a function named  `duplicates`  that takes an integer array  `arr`  and its size  `s`  as parameters.
4.  **Local Variables:**
    
    ```cpp
    int d_size = 0;
    int addr[s];
    
    ```
    
    -   `d_size`  is initialized to 0 and will keep track of the number of duplicate elements.
    -   `addr`  is an array that will store the addresses of duplicate elements.
5.  **Nested Loops:**
    
    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < s; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < s; j++) {
            // Comparison logic
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    -   The outer loop iterates through each element of the array.
    -   The inner loop compares the current element (at index  `i`) with subsequent elements (starting from index  `i+1`).
6.  **Duplicate Check:**
    
    ```cpp
    if (arr[i] == arr[j]) {
        addr[d_size++] = j;
        break;
    }
    
    ```
    
    -   If the elements at indices  `i`  and  `j`  are equal (i.e., a duplicate is found), the address  `j`  is stored in the  `addr`  array.
    -   `d_size`  is incremented to keep track of the number of duplicates.
    -   The  `break`  statement ensures that only the first occurrence of a duplicate is recorded.
7.  **Printing Duplicate Values:**
    
    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < d_size; i++) {
        cout << arr[addr[i]] << " value at address " << addr[i] << endl;
    }
    
    ```
    
    -   This loop prints the duplicate values along with their addresses.
    -   It uses the  `addr`  array to access the indices of duplicate elements.
8.  **Main Function:**
    
    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int my_array[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 10, 60, 20};
        int size = sizeof(my_array) / sizeof(int);
        duplicates(my_array, size);
        return 0;
    }
    
    ```
    
    -   In the  `main`  function:
        -   An array  `my_array`  is defined with some sample values.
        -   The size of the array is calculated using  `sizeof`.
        -   The  `duplicates`  function is called with  `my_array`  and its size.
        -   The program returns 0 (indicating successful execution).

   ## Example Output
   - For the given  `my_array`, the output will be:
    
    ```
    10 value at address 5
    20 value at address 7
    
    ```
    
    Here,  `10`  appears at index 5 (address 5) and  `20`  appears at index 7 (address 7).
