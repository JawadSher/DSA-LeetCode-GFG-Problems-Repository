# Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that takes an integer input \( N \) and prints a pattern of characters in a grid. Each row \( i \) should contain characters starting from 'A' plus the row index, up to 'A' plus the row index plus the number of characters in that row minus one. Each character in the row should be separated by a space.

### Constraints

`1 ≤ N ≤ 26`

### Example

#### Input
```
Enter the value of N: 4
```

#### Output
```
A 
B C 
C D E 
D E F G
```

## Problem Solution Explanation

- **Include Header and Namespace**:

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  ```

  - This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which provides basic input and output operations (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.

- **Main Function**:

  ```cpp
  int main() {
  ```

  - This defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program.

- **Variable Declaration and Input**:

  ```cpp
  int N;
  cout << "Enter the value of N : ";
  cin >> N;
  ```

  - Declares an integer variable `N` to store the user input for the number of rows (`N`).
  - Prompts the user to enter the value of `N`.
  - Reads and assigns the user input to the variable `N` using `cin`.

- **Outer While Loop (`while(row <= N) { ... }`)**:

  ```cpp
  int row = 1;
  while (row <= N) {
  ```

  - Initializes `row` to 1. This loop iterates from `row = 1` up to `N`.
  - Controls the number of rows in the output pattern.

- **Inner While Loop (`while(col <= row) { ... }`)**:

  ```cpp
  int col = 1;
  while (col <= row) {
  ```

  - Inside each iteration of the outer loop, initializes `col = 1`.
  - This loop iterates from `col = 1` up to `row`.
  - Controls the number of characters printed in each row of the output pattern.

- **Character Calculation**:

  ```cpp
  char ch = 'A' + row + col - 2;
  ```

  - Calculates the character to be printed in the current position of the grid.
  - For each iteration of the inner loop, `ch` is set to `'A' + row + col - 2`.
  - This formula determines the starting character for each row and increments based on the sum of `row` and `col`, adjusted by `-2` to get the correct sequence.

- **Output**:

  ```cpp
  cout << ch << " ";
  ```

  - Prints the character `ch` followed by a space.
  - Outputs each character in the current row separated by spaces.

- **End of Row**:

  ```cpp
  cout << endl;
  ```

  - Outputs an end-of-line character after printing all characters in the current row.
  - Moves to the next line to start printing the next row.

- **Increment Row Counter**:

  ```cpp
  row++;
  ```

  - After printing all characters for the current row (`col` from `1` to `row`), increments the `row` counter to move to the next row in the outer loop.

- **End of Program**:

  ```cpp
  return 0;
  ```

  - Indicates successful termination of the program to the operating system.

### Example Output

#### For `N = 4`:

```
Enter the value of N: 4
A 
B C 
C D E 
D E F G
```

### Summary

- This C++ program prompts the user to enter an integer `N`.
- It then prints `N` rows where each row `i` contains characters starting from `'A' + i - 1` up to `'A' + i - 1 + i - 1`, with each character separated by a space.
- The program uses nested `while` loops: the outer loop controls the number of rows (`row`), and the inner loop controls the number of characters per row (`col`), with `char ch = 'A' + row + col - 2;` calculating the character to print at each position in the pattern.

This explanation covers the functionality and structure of the C++ code snippet, detailing how it generates the specific output pattern based on user input.
