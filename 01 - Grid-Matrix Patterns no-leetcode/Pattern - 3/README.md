# Problem Statement

Create a C++ program that generates a square grid pattern based on a user-provided integer `N`. The grid should consist of `N` rows and `2N` columns, where each row contains consecutive numbers starting from `1` and incrementing sequentially up to `2N`. Each number should be followed by a space, and each row should start on a new line.

**Requirements:**

1. **Input:**
   - An integer `N` that specifies the number of rows and the number of columns in each row of the grid.

2. **Output:**
   - A grid with `N` rows and `2N` columns.
   - Each row should contain consecutive numbers starting from `1` and incrementing sequentially up to `2N`.
   - Each number in a row should be followed by a space.
   - Each row should end with a newline character.

**Constraints:**

- The value of `N` must be a positive integer.
- The maximum value of `N` should be within reasonable limits for practical display, e.g., up to `100`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
```
3
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18
```

**Explanation:**
- For `N = 3`, the program should print a grid with 3 rows and 6 columns (2 * 3). Each row contains consecutive numbers starting from 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
```
4
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
```

**Explanation:**
- For `N = 4`, the program should print a grid with 4 rows and 8 columns (2 * 4). Each row contains consecutive numbers starting from 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:**
```
5
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
```

**Explanation:**
- For `N = 5`, the program should print a grid with 5 rows and 10 columns (2 * 5). Each row contains consecutive numbers starting from 1.

## Problem Solution Explanation

- **Include Header and Namespace:**

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    ```

    - This includes the `<iostream>` standard library for input and output operations. `using namespace std;` allows using `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.

- **Main Function:**

    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int N;
        cout << "Enter a value for N: ";
        cin >> N;
    ```

    - Defines the `main()` function, the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `N` to store the user input.

- **Input:**

    ```cpp
    cout << "Enter a value for N: ";
    cin >> N;
    ```

    - Prompts the user to enter a value for `N` and stores it in the variable `N`.

- **Initialization:**

    ```cpp
    int row = 1;
    int num = 1;
    ```

    - Initializes `row` and `num` to `1`. `row` tracks the current row number in the output, and `num` is used to print consecutive numbers starting from `1`.

- **Nested While Loop for Output:**

    ```cpp
    while (row <= N) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= N + N) {
            cout << num << " ";
            col++;
            num++;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row++;
    }
    ```

    - **Outer Loop (`while (row <= N) { ... }`):**
        
        - Executes `N` times, once for each row. `row` starts at `1` and increments after each row is printed.

    - **Inner Loop (`while (col <= N + N) { ... }`):**

        - Executes `N + N` times (or `2N` times) for each row. `col` starts at `1` and increments after each number (`num`) is printed. `num` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each time a number is printed.
        
    - **Printing:**
        
        - `cout << num << " ";` prints the current value of `num` followed by a space.
        - After printing `2N` numbers, `endl` is used to move to the next line.

- **Output:**

    - After executing the nested loops, the program prints `N` rows, each containing `2N` numbers incrementing sequentially from `1`.

### Summary:

- The program takes an integer input `N` from the user.
- It prints a grid with `N` rows, each containing `2N` numbers in sequential order starting from `1`.
- The nested `while` loops control the rows and columns, and `num` tracks the current number to print.

This code demonstrates basic control flow using loops and input/output operations in C++, generating a specific pattern of numbers based on user input.
