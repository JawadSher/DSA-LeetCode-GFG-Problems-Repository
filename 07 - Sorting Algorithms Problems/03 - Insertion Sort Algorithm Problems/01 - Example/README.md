## Problem Statement
The goal is to sort an array of integers in non-decreasing order using the **Insertion Sort** algorithm. This sorting algorithm is straightforward, works similarly to the way you might sort playing cards, and is particularly effective for small datasets or nearly sorted data.

### Insertion Sort Algorithm: Detailed Explanation

**Insertion Sort** builds the sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It takes each element from the input array and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted portion of the array.

Here's how the insertion sort algorithm works step by step:

1. **Start** with the second element in the array (index 1), considering the first element (index 0) as a sorted sub-array.
2. **Compare** the current element (often called `key`) with the elements in the sorted portion of the array (those to the left of it).
3. **Shift** all the elements in the sorted portion that are greater than the `key` one position to the right. This creates space for the `key` to be inserted.
4. **Insert** the `key` into its correct position in the sorted portion.
5. **Repeat** this process for each element in the array until the entire array is sorted.


## Problem Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

void insertion_sort(vector<int>& nums){
  for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++){
    int key = nums[i];
    
    int j = i-1;
    for(; j >= 0; j--){
      if(nums[j] > key){
        nums[j+1] = nums[j];
      }else{
        break;
      }
    }
    nums[j+1] = key;
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<int> nums = {10, 2, 3, 8, 5, 1, 4, 7, 9, 6};
  insertion_sort(nums);

  for(int i : nums){
    cout<<i<<" ";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Problem Solution Explanation
Let's go through the `insertion_sort` function and `main` function line by line, explaining each part in detail.

### `insertion_sort` Function

```cpp
void insertion_sort(vector<int>& nums) {
```

- **Line 1:** 
  - This is the function declaration for `insertion_sort`.
  - `void` means the function does not return any value.
  - `vector<int>& nums` is a reference to a vector of integers passed to the function, meaning that the function will modify the original vector, not a copy of it.

```cpp
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
```

- **Line 2:**
  - This `for` loop starts with `i = 1` and iterates through the vector until `i` is less than the size of the vector (`nums.size()`).
  - The loop index `i` represents the current element that we are going to insert into the sorted portion of the array (which is the part of the array before `i`).

```cpp
        int key = nums[i];
```

- **Line 3:**
  - `key` stores the current element (`nums[i]`) that we want to insert into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
  - This is the element that will be compared against the elements in the sorted portion.

```cpp
        int j = i - 1;
```

- **Line 4:**
  - `j` is initialized to `i - 1`, meaning it starts at the last element in the sorted portion of the array.
  - The variable `j` will be used to compare the elements in the sorted portion against the `key`.

```cpp
        while (j >= 0 && nums[j] > key) {
```

- **Line 5:**
  - This `while` loop runs as long as `j` is non-negative (indicating there are elements to compare) and the current element in the sorted portion (`nums[j]`) is greater than the `key`.
  - If `nums[j] > key`, it means the current element is out of order, so it needs to be shifted to the right to make room for the `key`.

```cpp
            nums[j + 1] = nums[j];
```

- **Line 6:**
  - This line shifts the element at index `j` (`nums[j]`) one position to the right (`nums[j + 1]`).
  - This effectively makes space for the `key` by moving the larger element to the right.

```cpp
            j--;
```

- **Line 7:**
  - Decrement `j` by 1 to move to the next element on the left in the sorted portion of the array.
  - The loop continues to shift elements until we find the correct position for the `key` or reach the start of the array.

```cpp
        nums[j + 1] = key;
```

- **Line 8:**
  - After the `while` loop completes, `j` will be at the index where the `key` should be inserted.
  - `nums[j + 1] = key;` places the `key` in its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

```cpp
    }
```

- **Line 9:**
  - This closes the `for` loop. The process is repeated for each element in the array until the entire array is sorted.

```cpp
}
```

- **Line 10:**
  - This closes the `insertion_sort` function.

### `main` Function

```cpp
int main() {
```

- **Line 1:**
  - This is the `main` function where the program execution begins.
  - The `int` indicates that the function will return an integer value (usually `0` for successful execution).

```cpp
    vector<int> nums = {10, 2, 3, 8, 5, 1, 4, 7, 9, 6};
```

- **Line 2:**
  - A vector of integers named `nums` is declared and initialized with the given list of integers.
  - This is the array we want to sort using the insertion sort algorithm.

```cpp
    insertion_sort(nums);
```

- **Line 3:**
  - The `insertion_sort` function is called with `nums` passed as an argument.
  - Since `nums` is passed by reference, the function will sort the original vector.

```cpp
    for (int i : nums) {
```

- **Line 4:**
  - This is a range-based `for` loop that iterates over each element in the sorted vector `nums`.
  - The loop variable `i` takes the value of each element in the vector one by one.

```cpp
        cout << i << " ";
```

- **Line 5:**
  - This line prints the current element (`i`) followed by a space.
  - This effectively prints the sorted array to the console.

```cpp
    }
```

- **Line 6:**
  - This closes the range-based `for` loop.

```cpp
    return 0;
```

- **Line 7:**
  - This returns `0` to indicate that the program has executed successfully.
  - The `main` function ends here.

```cpp
}
```

- **Line 8:**
  - This closes the `main` function.


### Time Complexity

1. **Best Case (O(n)):**
   - In the best-case scenario, the array is already sorted. 
   - The algorithm still iterates through the array, but since each element is already in its correct position, no shifting is required.
   - The inner `while` loop never executes, meaning the time complexity is linear, i.e., \( O(n) \).

2. **Average Case (O(n^2)):**
   - In the average case, the elements are in random order.
   - The number of comparisons and shifts required depends on how unsorted the array is.
   - On average, each element might be compared with half of the elements in the sorted portion, leading to a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \).

3. **Worst Case (O(n^2)):**
   - In the worst-case scenario, the array is sorted in reverse order.
   - The algorithm will need to compare each element with all previously sorted elements, shifting all of them to the right.
   - For example, the first element is compared 0 times, the second element is compared 1 time, and so on, leading to a quadratic time complexity, i.e., \( O(n^2) \).

### Space Complexity

1. **Space Complexity (O(1)):**
   - The algorithm sorts the array in place, meaning it doesnâ€™t require any additional space proportional to the input size.
   - Only a constant amount of extra memory is used for variables like `key`, `i`, and `j`.
   - Therefore, the space complexity is \( O(1) \).

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Best Case:** \( O(n) \)
  - The array is already sorted. The algorithm just loops through the array with minimal operations, resulting in linear time complexity.

- **Average Case:** \( O(n^2) \)
  - The array is in random order. On average, each element needs to be compared and shifted with half of the previously sorted elements, leading to quadratic time complexity.

- **Worst Case:** \( O(n^2) \)
  - The array is sorted in reverse order. Every new element will need to be compared with all previous elements, making it the worst-case scenario with quadratic time complexity.

- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \)
  - Since the algorithm only requires a constant amount of additional space (no extra data structures), the space complexity is constant.

### Summary:

- **Insertion Sort** is efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays due to its simple implementation and good performance in the best case.
- However, it becomes inefficient for large, randomly ordered, or reverse-ordered arrays due to its \( O(n^2) \) time complexity in the average and worst cases.
- The algorithm is in-place and requires only \( O(1) \) extra space.
