<p align='center'>
Welcome to the 'Linked List Problems' repository! This repository contains a collection of problems that focus on **Linked List** data structures. Linked Lists are a fundamental data structure, essential for understanding memory management and creating efficient data structures like stacks, queues, and others.

## About Linked Lists

A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. There are different types of Linked Lists, such as:

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has two references: one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node.
- **Circular Linked List**: A type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node.

This repository includes various challenges involving Linked List operations, such as:

- Insertion and Deletion operations
- Reversal of Linked Lists
- Detecting cycles
- Merging two linked lists
- Finding the middle element
- And more!

Each problem in this repository is designed to help you understand Linked Lists in depth. Whether you're just starting to learn about Linked Lists or looking to sharpen your problem-solving skills, this collection will assist you in mastering this important data structure.

## Problem List

Here you will find a list of problems organized by type of Linked List. For each problem, you'll find a description and a link to the corresponding folder in this repository.

Start solving and exploring to get hands-on experience with Linked Lists and improve your coding skills!
