# Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to generate and print a pattern based on a user-defined number of rows \( N \). The pattern should consist of numbers and dashes where:

1. Each row starts with a certain number of dashes (`-`).
2. After the dashes, the current row number is repeated as many times as the remaining columns.

The number of dashes increases with each subsequent row, while the number of repeated digits decreases.

### Constraints

-  ( N ) (number of rows) is a positive integer.
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 20`

## Example

**Input:**

```
Enter the number of rows: 4
```

**Output:**

```
1 1 1 1 
- 2 2 2 
- - 3 3 
- - - 4
```

## Source Code Explanation

- **Include necessary libraries:**

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    ```

    - This includes the standard input-output stream (`iostream`) library and uses the `std` namespace.

- **Main function definition:**

    ```cpp
    int main() {
        // Code for the program
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    - `main()` is the entry point of every C++ program.

- **Variable declaration and user input:**

    ```cpp
    int N;
    cout << "Enter the number of rows: ";
    cin >> N;
    ```

    - `int N;` declares an integer variable `N`.
    - `cout << "Enter the number of rows: ";` prompts the user to enter a value for `N`.
    - `cin >> N;` reads an integer value from the user input and assigns it to `N`.

- **Nested while loops for pattern printing:**

    ```cpp
    int row = 1;
    while (row <= N) {
        int space = 1;
        
        // Print dashes for indentation based on current row number
        while (space < row) {
            cout << "-" << " ";
            space++;
        }
        
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= N - row + 1) {
            // Print current row number followed by space
            cout << row << " ";
            col++;
        }
        
        // Move to the next line after each row
        cout << endl;
        row++;
    }
    ```

    - **Outer `while` loop (`row` loop):**
        
        - `int row = 1;` initializes `row` to `1`.
        - `while (row <= N) { ... }` continues as long as `row` is less than or equal to `N`.
        - Each iteration of the outer loop handles one row of the pattern.

    - **First inner `while` loop (`space` loop):**
        
        - `int space = 1;` initializes `space` to `1`.
        - `while (space < row) { ... }` continues as long as `space` is less than `row`.
        - Each iteration of this loop prints `-` followed by a space.
        - This loop creates the left part of the pattern where dashes (`-`) are printed for indentation.

    - **Second inner `while` loop (`col` loop):**
        
        - `int col = 1;` initializes `col` to `1`.
        - `while (col <= N - row + 1) { ... }` continues as long as `col` is less than or equal to `N - row + 1`.
        - Each iteration of this loop prints the current `row` number followed by a space.
        - This loop creates the right part of the pattern where numbers representing the current row are printed.

    - **Output:**
        
        - After printing dashes (`-`), numbers, and spaces for each row, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line to start a new row.

    - **End of `row` loop:**
        
        - `row++;` increments `row` to move to the next row, repeating the process until `row` exceeds `N`.

- **End of `main` function:**

    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```

    - This statement indicates the end of the `main` function and the program. It returns `0` to the operating system, indicating successful execution.
