Here's a breakdown of the code and the pattern it creates.

## Source Code Explanation 

-  **Header and Namespace:**
    
    -   `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the `iostream` header file, which provides input/output functionalities for the program. You'll use `cout` for printing to the console and `cin` for getting user input.
    -   `using namespace std;`: This line declares the use of the `std` namespace, which contains standard library components frequently used in C++.
-  **Main Function:**
    
    -   `int main() {`: This line defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of your C++ program. The code execution begins here.
-  **Variable Declaration:**
    
    -   `int N;`: Declares an integer variable `N` to store the number of rows the user will enter later.
-  **User Input:**
    
    -   `cout << "Enter the value of N : ";`: Prompts the user to enter a value for `N` using `cout`.
    -   `cin >> N;`: Reads the user's input and stores it in the `N` variable using `cin`.
-  **Outer Loop for Rows (while loop):**
    
    -   `int row = 1;`: Initializes a variable `row` to 1, which will be used as the counter for the number of rows.
    -   `while(row <= N) {`: This `while` loop continues as long as `row` is less than or equal to `N` (the number of rows entered by the user). This loop controls the number of rows printed in the pattern.
        -   The entire indented code block below this line will be executed repeatedly for each iteration of the `while` loop.
-  **Inner Loop for Columns (while loop):**
    
    -   `int col = 1;`: Initializes a variable `col` to 1, which will be used as the counter for the number of characters in each row.
    -   `while(col <= row) {`: This `while` loop continues as long as `col` is less than or equal to `row`. This loop controls the number of characters printed in each row.
        -   The indented code block below this line will be executed repeatedly for each iteration of the inner `while` loop.
-  **Character Calculation and Printing:**
    
    -   `char ch = 'D' - row + col;`: Calculates the character to be printed based on the current `row` and `col` values. It subtracts `row - 1` from 'D' (which has an ASCII code of 68) to get the corresponding character code.
    -   `cout << ch << " ";`: Prints the calculated character `ch` followed by a space using `cout`.
-  **Increment and Newline:**
    
    -   `col++;`: Increments the `col` counter to move to the next character in the current row.
    -   `cout << endl;`: Prints a newline character `endl` after each row is complete, moving the output cursor to the next line.
-  **Outer Loop Increment:**
    
    -   `row++;`: Increments the `row` counter to move to the next row after all characters in the current row have been printed.
-  **Program Termination:**
    

-   `return 0;`: Indicates successful program termination by returning 0 from the `main` function.

## Example Output

When you run this code and enter a value for `N`, the program will print a triangular pattern of characters. For example, if you enter `N = 4`, the output will be:

```
D 
C D 
B C D 
A B C D 

```

As you can see, the pattern starts with 'D' in the first row and decrements by one character (based on the ASCII code) as you move down the rows. Each row has one more character than the previous row.
