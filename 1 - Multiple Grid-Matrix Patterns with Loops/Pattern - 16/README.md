# Problem Statement

You are tasked with writing a C++ program that prints a specific pattern based on user input. The pattern consists of underscores (`_`) and asterisks (`*`) arranged in a right-aligned triangular format. 

### **Pattern Description**

Given a number `N`, your program should generate a pattern of `N` rows. Each row starts with a number of underscores, followed by a number of asterisks. 

- The first row starts with `N - 1` underscores and 1 asterisk.
- The second row starts with `N - 2` underscores and 2 asterisks.
- This continues until the last row which contains only asterisks with no leading underscores.

### **Constraints**

- **1 ≤ N ≤ 100**: The number of rows (`N`) should be a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

### **Input**

- An integer `N` representing the number of rows in the pattern.

### **Output**

- A pattern of `N` rows with each row containing underscores followed by asterisks as described.

## Example

### **Input**

```
5
```

### **Output**

```
_ _ _ _ * 
_ _ _ * * 
_ _ * * * 
_ * * * * 
* * * * *
```

### **Explanation**

1. For `N = 5`, the pattern has 5 rows:
   - **Row 1:** Prints 4 underscores and 1 asterisk.
   - **Row 2:** Prints 3 underscores and 2 asterisks.
   - **Row 3:** Prints 2 underscores and 3 asterisks.
   - **Row 4:** Prints 1 underscore and 4 asterisks.
   - **Row 5:** Prints 0 underscores and 5 asterisks.


### **Detailed Explanation**

- **Header and Namespace:**
  - `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard I/O stream library.
  - `using namespace std;`: Avoids prefixing `std::` to standard library components.

- **Main Function:**
  - Entry point of the program where execution starts.

- **Variable Declaration and Input:**
  - `int N;` declares the variable to store user input.
  - `cout` and `cin` are used to prompt the user and read the number of rows.

- **Pattern Printing Logic:**
  - **Outer Loop:** Controls the number of rows.
  - **Inner Loops:**
    - **Space Loop:** Prints underscores.
    - **Column Loop:** Prints asterisks.
  - **Row Increment:** Moves to the next row after printing the current row.

- **Output:** 
  - The program generates the pattern with decreasing underscores and increasing asterisks for each row.

## Problem Solution Explanation

### **Include Necessary Libraries and Namespace:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

- **`#include <iostream>`**:
  - This line includes the standard input-output stream library, which is essential for performing input and output operations in C++.
  - It provides functionalities like `cout` for printing data to the console and `cin` for reading user input.

- **`using namespace std;`**:
  - This line tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace. It allows us to write `cout` and `cin` without prefixing them with `std::`.
  - Without this line, you would need to write `std::cout` and `std::cin` for input and output operations.

### **Main Function Definition:**

```cpp
int main() {
    // Code for the program
    return 0;
}
```

- **`int main()`**:
  - This is the main function where the execution of the program starts.
  - Every C++ program must have a `main` function, and the execution begins from here.

- **`return 0;`**:
  - Indicates successful termination of the program.
  - It returns `0` to the operating system to signify that the program has ended correctly.

### **Variable Declaration and User Input:**

```cpp
int N;
cout << "Enter the number of rows: ";
cin >> N;
```

- **`int N;`**:
  - Declares an integer variable `N` to store the number of rows the user wants to print.

- **`cout << "Enter the number of rows: ";`**:
  - Prints the prompt to the console asking the user to enter the number of rows.
  
- **`cin >> N;`**:
  - Reads the integer value entered by the user and stores it in the variable `N`.

### **Nested While Loops for Pattern Printing:**

```cpp
int row = 1;
while (row <= N) {
    int space = 1;
    while (space <= N - row + 1) {
        cout << "_" << " ";
        space++;
    }

    int col = 1;
    while (col <= row) {
        cout << "*" << " ";
        col++;
    }
    cout << endl;
    row++;
}
```

- **Outer While Loop (`row` Loop):**

  ```cpp
  int row = 1;
  while (row <= N) {
  ```

  - Initializes `row` to `1`. This loop will iterate from `1` to `N`, controlling the number of rows.
  - **`while (row <= N)`**: Continues as long as `row` is less than or equal to `N`. Each iteration handles the printing of one row.

- **First Inner While Loop (`space` Loop):**

  ```cpp
  int space = 1;
  while (space <= N - row + 1) {
  ```

  - Initializes `space` to `1`. This loop prints the underscores (`_`) for each row.
  - **`while (space <= N - row + 1)`**: Continues as long as `space` is less than or equal to `N - row + 1`. The number of underscores decreases as `row` increases, creating a right-aligned effect.
  - **`cout << "_" << " ";`**: Prints an underscore followed by a space. This is used for padding.

- **Second Inner While Loop (`col` Loop):**

  ```cpp
  int col = 1;
  while (col <= row) {
  ```

  - Initializes `col` to `1`. This loop prints the stars (`*`) in each row.
  - **`while (col <= row)`**: Continues as long as `col` is less than or equal to `row`. The number of stars increases as the `row` number increases.
  - **`cout << "*" << " ";`**: Prints a star followed by a space.

- **Print Newline and Increment:**

  ```cpp
  cout << endl;
  row++;
  ```

  - **`cout << endl;`**: Prints a newline character after finishing printing all characters in the current row. Moves the cursor to the next line.
  - **`row++;`**: Increments the `row` counter to move to the next row in the outer loop.

### **Program Termination:**

```cpp
return 0;
```

- Indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns control to the operating system.

## Example Output

### For `N = 5`:

If the user inputs `5`, the program will output:

```
_ _ _ _ * 
_ _ _ * * 
_ _ * * * 
_ * * * * 
* * * * *
```

### Explanation of Output:

- **Row 1:** Prints 4 underscores followed by 1 star.
- **Row 2:** Prints 3 underscores followed by 2 stars.
- **Row 3:** Prints 2 underscores followed by 3 stars.
- **Row 4:** Prints 1 underscore followed by 4 stars.
- **Row 5:** Prints 5 stars without any leading underscores.

### Summary

- The program prompts the user for a number `N` to determine the number of rows in the output pattern.
- It prints a pattern consisting of underscores followed by stars, forming a right-aligned triangle.
- As the row number increases, the number of underscores decreases while the number of stars increases.
- The pattern is generated using nested `while` loops, demonstrating control flow and formatting in C++.

This detailed explanation covers the functionality of each part of the code and how it contributes to generating the specified output pattern.
