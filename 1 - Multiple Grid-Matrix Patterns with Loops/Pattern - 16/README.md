Let's break down the provided C++ code step by step.

## Source Code Explanation
-  **Include necessary libraries:**
    
    
    ```#include <iostream>```
    
	```using namespace std;``` 
    
    -   This includes the standard input-output stream (`iostream`) library and uses the `std` namespace.

-  **Main function definition:**
    
    
    ```
    int main() {
        // Code for the program
        return 0;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   `main()` is the entry point of every C++ program.
- **Variable declaration and user input:**
    
    
    ```
    int N;
    
    cout << "Enter the number of rows: ";
    cin >> N;
    ``` 
    
    -   `int N;` declares an integer variable `N`.
    -   `cout << "Enter the number of rows: ";` prompts the user to enter a value for `N`.
    -   `cin >> N;` reads an integer value from the user input and assigns it to `N`.
- **Nested while loops for pattern printing:**
    
    ```
    int row = 1;
    while (row <= N) {
        int space = 1;
        while (space <= N - row + 1) {
            cout << "_" << " ";
            space++;
        }
    
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= row) {
            cout << "*" << " ";
            col = col + 1;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   **Outer `while` loop (`row` loop)**:
        
        -   `int row = 1;` initializes `row` to `1`.
        -   `while (row <= N) { ... }` continues as long as `row` is less than or equal to `N`.
        -   Each iteration of the outer loop handles one row of the pattern.
    -   **First inner `while` loop (`space` loop)**:
        
        -   `int space = 1;` initializes `space` to `1`.
        -   `while (space <= N - row + 1) { ... }` continues as long as `space` is less than or equal to `N - row + 1`.
        -   Each iteration of this loop prints `_` followed by a space.
        -   This loop creates spaces before printing the `*` in each row, making the pattern right-aligned.
    -   **Second inner `while` loop (`col` loop)**:
        
        -   `int col = 1;` initializes `col` to `1`.
        -   `while (col <= row) { ... }` continues as long as `col` is less than or equal to `row`.
        -   Each iteration of this loop prints `*` followed by a space.
        -   This loop prints the stars (`*`) in each row according to the value of `row`.
    -   **Output**:
        
        -   After printing the spaces and stars for each row, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line to start a new row.
    -   **End of `row` loop**:
        
        -   `row++;` increments `row` to move to the next row, repeating the process until `row` exceeds `N`.

- **End of `main` function:**
    
    
    `return 0;` 
    
    -   This statement indicates the end of the `main` function and the program. It returns `0` to the operating system, indicating successful execution.

## Example Output:

-   If the user enters `N = 5`, the program will output:
    
    
``` 
    _ _ _ _ * 
    _ _ _ * * 
    _ _ * * * 
    _ * * * * 
    * * * * *
``` 
    

### Summary:

-   The program prompts the user to enter a number `N`, which determines the number of rows in the pattern.
-   It prints a pattern where each row has a certain number of `_` followed by `*`, forming a right-aligned triangle.
-   The number of `_` decreases as the row number increases, and the number of `*` increases as the row number increases.
-   This program demonstrates the use of nested `while` loops, input-output operations (`cout` and `cin`), and basic control structures in C++.
