Let's break down and explain the C++ code snippet you provided.

## Source Code Explanation

- **Include Header and Namespace**:
    
    ```#include <iostream>```
    
    ```using namespace std;``` 
    
    -   This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which provides basic input and output operations (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.

- **Main Function**:
    
    ```
    int main() {
      int N;
    
      cout << "Enter the value of N: ";
      cin >> N;
    ``` 
    
    -   This defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `N` to store user input.

-  **Input**:
    
    ```cout << "Enter the value of N: ";```
    
    ```cin >> N;``` 
    
    -   Prompts the user to enter a value for `N` and stores it in the variable `N`.
- **Initialization**:
    
     ```int row = 1;```
     
     ``` int num = row;``` 
    
    -   Initializes two integer variables:
        -   `row` is initialized to 1 and is used to track the current row number in the output pattern.
        -   `num` is initialized to `row`. It will be used to print sequential numbers starting from the current row number.
-  **Nested While Loop for Output**:
    
    
     ```
     while (row <= N) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= row) {
          cout << num << " ";
          col++;
          num++;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row++;
      }
      ``` 
    
    -   **Outer Loop (`while (row <= N) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `N` times, once for each row from 1 up to `N`.
        -   `row` increments after each row is printed.
    -   **Inner Loop (`while (col <= row) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `row` times for each row, starting from 1 up to the current value of `row`.
        -   `col` increments after printing each number (`num`).
   
    -   **Printing**:
        
        -   `cout << num << " ";` prints the current value of `num` followed by a space for each iteration of the inner loop.
        -   After printing all numbers for the current `row`, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line to start a new row.
-  **Output**:
    
    -   After the execution of the nested loops, the program prints a pattern of numbers where each row `i` contains sequential numbers starting from `i`.
    -   For example, the first row prints `1`, the second row prints `2 3`, the third row prints `4 5 6`, and so on up to `N`.

## Example Output (for `N = 4`):

```
Enter the value of N: 4
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10
``` 

### Summary:

-   This program takes an integer input `N` from the user.
-   It then prints `N` rows where each row `i` contains `i` sequential numbers starting from the last printed number plus 1.
-   The program uses nested while loops to achieve this output, with `row` controlling the number of rows, `col` controlling the number of numbers per row, and `num` keeping track of the sequence of numbers printed.

This code snippet demonstrates basic control flow using loops and input/output operations in C++, and it showcases how to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on user input.
