Let's delve into the explanation of your C++ source code.

## Source Code Explanation
-  **Include Header and Namespace**:
    
   ```#include<iostream>```
    
	```using namespace std;``` 
    
    -   This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which provides basic input and output operations (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.

-  **Main Function**:
    
    `int main(){` 
    
    -   This is the main function where the execution of the program begins.

-  **Variable Declaration and Input**:
    
    
    ```
    int N;
    cout<<"Enter the value of N : ";
    cin>>N;
    ``` 
    
    -   Declares an integer variable `N` to store the user input for the number of rows (`N`).
    -   Prompts the user to enter the value of `N`.
    -   Reads and assigns the user input to the variable `N` using `cin`.

-  **Outer While Loop (`while(row <= N) { ... }`)**:
    
    -   This loop iterates from `row = 1` up to `N`.
    -   Controls the number of rows in the output pattern.

-  **Inner While Loop (`while(col <= row) { ... }`)**:
    
    -   Inside each iteration of the outer loop, initializes `col = 1`.
    -   This loop iterates from `col = 1` up to `row`.
    -   Controls the number of characters printed in each row of the output pattern.

-  **Character Calculation**:
    
    
    `char ch = 'A' + row + col - 2;` 
    
    -   Calculates the character to be printed in the current position of the grid.
    -   For each iteration of the inner loop, `ch` is set to `'A' + row + col - 2`.
    -   Starts with `'A'` and increments based on the sum of `row` and `col`, adjusted by `-2` to get the correct sequence.

-  **Output**:
    
    `cout<<ch<<" ";` 
    
    -   Prints the character `ch` followed by a space.
    -   Outputs each character in the current row separated by spaces.

- **End of Row**:
    
    
    `cout<<endl;` 
    
    -   Outputs an end-of-line character after printing all characters in the current row.
    -   Moves to the next line to start printing the next row.

-  **Increment Row Counter**:
    
    
    `row++;` 
    
    -   After printing all characters for the current row (`col` from `1` to `row`), increments the `row` counter to move to the next row in the outer loop.

-  **End of Program**:

    ```return 0;``` 
    
    - Indicates successful termination of the program to the operating system.

## Example Output (for `N = 4`):

If the user enters `4` as the value of `N`, the program will generate the following output:

```
Enter the value of N : 4
A 
B C 
C D E 
D E F G
``` 

### Summary:

-   This C++ program prompts the user to enter an integer `N`.
-   It then prints a pattern of characters where each row `i` contains characters starting from `'A' + i` up to `'A' + i + (i - 1)`, repeated `i` times horizontally.
-   The program uses nested `while` loops to achieve this output, with the outer loop controlling the number of rows (`row`), and the inner loop controlling the number of characters per row (`col`), based on the formula `char ch = 'A' + row + col - 2;`.

This explanation covers the functionality and structure of your provided C++ code snippet, detailing how it generates the specific output pattern based on user input.
