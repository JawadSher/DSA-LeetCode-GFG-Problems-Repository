# Problem Statement

The task is to create a C++ program that generates a square grid pattern based on a user-provided integer `N`. The grid should consist of `N` rows and `N` columns, where each row contains numbers from 1 to `N`. The output should be formatted such that each number is followed by a space, and each row starts on a new line.

## Requirements

1.  **Input:**
    
    -   An integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), representing the size of the grid.
2.  **Output:**
    
    -   A square grid with `N` rows and `N` columns.
    -   Each number in the row should be separated by a space.
    -   Each row should start on a new line.

## Examples

1.  **Example 1:**
    
    **Input:**
    
    
    `3` 
    
    **Output:**
    
    
    ```
    1 2 3
    1 2 3
    1 2 3
    ``` 
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    -   For `N = 3`, the program outputs a 3x3 grid where each row contains numbers from 1 to 3.
2.  **Example 2:**
    
    **Input:**
    
    
    `4` 
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```
    1 2 3 4
    1 2 3 4
    1 2 3 4
    1 2 3 4
    ``` 
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    -   For `N = 4`, the program outputs a 4x4 grid where each row contains numbers from 1 to 4.
3.  **Example 3:**
    
    **Input:**
    
    
    `5` 
    
    **Output:**
    
    
    ```
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    ``` 
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    -   For `N = 5`, the program outputs a 5x5 grid where each row contains numbers from 1 to 5.

### Constraints

-   `1 ≤ N ≤ 100`

## Problem Solution

-   **Header inclusion and namespace declaration:**
    
    ```
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    ``` 
    
    This includes the necessary input-output stream library (`iostream`) and declares that we will be using the `std` namespace, which contains standard C++ library functions and objects.
    
-   **Main function definition:**
    
   
    
    ```
    int main() {
        // Code for the program
        return 0;
    }
    ``` 
    
    Every C++ program must have a `main` function, which serves as the entry point of the program.
    
-   **Variable declaration:**
    

    
    ```
    int N;
    ``` 
    
    Declares an integer variable `N` to store the user input, which represents the size of the pattern (N x N).
    
-   **User input:**

    
    ```
    cout << "Enter the value of N: ";
    cin >> N;
    ``` 
    
    Prompts the user to enter the value of N and reads this value from the standard input (`cin`). The user-entered value will determine the size of the pattern.
    
-   **Nested while loops for pattern printing:**
    
    ```
    int row = 1;
    while (row <= N) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= N) {
            cout << col << " ";
            col++;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   **Outer loop (`row` loop):** Controls the number of rows in the pattern. It runs from `row = 1` to `row = N`.
    -   **Inner loop (`col` loop):** Controls the number of columns in each row. It runs from `col = 1` to `col = N`.
    -   Within the inner loop:
        -   `cout << col << " ";` : Prints the current column number followed by a space.
        -   `col++;` : Increments the column number for the next iteration of the inner loop.
    -   After the inner loop completes printing numbers for one row (`col` loop), `cout << endl;` is used to move to the next line, creating the row break.
    -   `row++;` : Moves to the next row after finishing printing the current row.
-   **End of main function:**
    
    
    ```
    return 0;
    ``` 
    
    Indicates successful completion of the `main` function and the program.
    

## Explanation of the Pattern Produced

For example, if the user inputs `N = 4`, the program will output:


```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
``` 

Each row contains numbers from 1 to N (in this case, 4) separated by spaces.

## Summary

-   The program uses nested while loops to print a square pattern of numbers.
-   It reads an integer N from the user, which determines both the number of rows and the number of columns in the pattern.
-   The outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop controls the columns within each row.
-   After printing each row, a newline character (`endl`) is used to move to the next line for the next row.

This program demonstrates basic input/output operations and loop structures in C++.
