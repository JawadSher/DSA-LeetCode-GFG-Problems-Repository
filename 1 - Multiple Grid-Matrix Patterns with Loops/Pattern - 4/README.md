Let's break down and explain the C++ code snippet.
## Source Code Explanation

- **Include Header and Namespace**:
    
    ```#include <iostream>```
  
    ```using namespace std;```
    
    -   This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which provides basic input and output streams (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.
-  **Main Function**:
    ```
    int main() {
      int N;
      cout << "Enter the value of N: ";
      cin >> N;
     ``` 
    
    -   This defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `N` to store user input.
    
- **Input**:
    
     ```cout << "Enter the value of N: ";```
     
     ```cin >> N;``` 
    
    -   Prompts the user to enter a value for `N` and stores it in the variable `N`.
-  **Initialization**:
  
     `int row = 1;` 
    
    -   Initializes the variable `row` to 1. `row` will track the current row number in the output pattern.
    
-  **Nested While Loop for Output**:
    
    ```
     while (row <= N) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= row) {
          cout << "*" << " ";
          col++;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row++;
      }
     ``` 
    
    -   **Outer Loop (`while (row <= N) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `N` times, once for each row, starting from 1 up to `N`.
        -   `row` increments after each row is printed.
    -   **Inner Loop (`while (col <= row) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `row` times for each row, starting from 1 up to the current value of `row`.
        -   `col` increments after printing each `*`.
    -   **Printing**:
        
        -   `cout << "*" << " ";` prints a `*` followed by a space for each iteration of the inner loop.
        -   After printing all `*` for the current `row`, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line to start a new row.
- **Output**:
    
    -   After the execution of the nested loops, the program prints a pattern of asterisks (`*`) where the number of asterisks in each row increases incrementally from 1 to `N`.

## Example Output (for `N = 5`):


```
Enter the value of N: 5
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *
``` 

### Summary:

-   This program takes an integer input `N` from the user.
-   It then prints `N` rows of asterisks (`*`), where the number of asterisks in each row corresponds to the row number (1st row has 1 `*`, 2nd row has 2 `*`, and so on).
-   The program uses nested while loops to achieve this output, with `row` controlling the number of rows and `col` controlling the number of asterisks per row.

This code snippet demonstrates basic control flow using loops and input/output operations in C++, and it showcases how to generate a specific pattern of asterisks based on user input.
