## Source Code Explanation 

-  **Variable Declaration and Input:**
    
    ```int N;```
    
    ```cout << "Enter the value of N: ";```
    
    ```cin >> N;``` 
    
    -   An integer variable `N` is declared.
    -   The program prompts the user to enter a value for `N` and stores it in the variable `N`.
-  **Outer While Loop (Rows):**
    
    ```int row = 1;```
    
    ```while (row <= N) {``` 
    
    -   `row` is initialized to 1.
    -   This loop will iterate from `row = 1` to `row = N`. Each iteration corresponds to a row in the output pattern.
-  **First Inner While Loop (Spaces):**
    
    ```
    int space = 1;
    while (space < row) {
      cout << "-" << " ";
      space++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   `space` is initialized to 1.
    -   This loop prints a dash (`-`) followed by a space. It runs `row - 1` times, so the number of dashes printed increases with each row.
    -   For example, when `row = 1`, it prints 0 dashes; when `row = 2`, it prints 1 dash; when `row = 3`, it prints 2 dashes, and so on.
- **Second Inner While Loop (Numbers):**
    
    ```
    int col = 1;
    int num = row;
    while (col <= N-row+1) {
      cout << num << " ";
      col++;
      num++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   `col` is initialized to 1, and `num` is initialized to the current `row` value.
    -   This loop prints numbers starting from `num` and increments `num` in each iteration.
    -   The loop runs `N - row + 1` times, so the number of numbers printed decreases with each row.
    -   For example, when `row = 1` and `N = 4`, it prints 4 numbers starting from 1; when `row = 2`, it prints 3 numbers starting from 2; when `row = 3`, it prints 2 numbers starting from 3, and so on.
- **End of Row:**
    
    ```cout << endl;```
    
    ```row++;``` 
    
    -   After printing the dashes and numbers for the current row, a newline character is printed to move to the next line.
    -   `row` is incremented to process the next row.
    
-  **Return Statement:**
    
    `return 0;` 
    
    -   The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

### Example Output

Let's see what the output looks like for different values of `N`.

## Example Output 1: N = 3

```
Enter the value of N: 3
1 2 3 
- 2 3 
- - 3
``` 

## Example Output 2: N = 4

```
Enter the value of N: 4
1 2 3 4 
- 2 3 4 
- - 3 4 
- - - 4
``` 

### Summary

-   The outer loop iterates over each row.
-   The first inner loop prints `row - 1` dashes for each row.
-   The second inner loop prints `N - row + 1` numbers starting from the current row number for each row.
-   The pattern consists of an increasing number of dashes followed by a decreasing sequence of numbers as the rows progress.
