Let's go through the C++ code provided to you  in the file main.cpp step by step.

## Source Code Explanation

- **Include Header and Namespace**:
    
	 ```#include<iostream>```
    
	 ```using namespace std;``` 
    
    -   This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which provides basic input and output operations (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.
-  **Main Function**:
    
    `int main() {
      int N;
      cout << "Enter the value of N: ";
      cin >> N;` 
    
    -   This defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `N` to store user input.
-  **Input**:
    
     ```cout << "Enter the value of N: ";```
     ```cin >> N;``` 
    
    -   Prompts the user to enter a value for `N` and stores it in the variable `N`.
-  **Initialization**:

     `int row = 1;` 
    
    -   Initializes the variable `row` to 1. `row` will track the current row number in the output pattern.
- **Nested While Loop for Output**:
    
     ```
     while (row <= N) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= row) {
          cout << row << " ";
          col = col + 1;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row = row + 1;
      }
     ``` 
    
    -   **Outer Loop (`while (row <= N) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `N` times, once for each row, starting from 1 up to `N`.
        -   `row` increments after each row is printed.
    -   **Inner Loop (`while (col <= row) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `row` times for each row, starting from 1 up to the current value of `row`.
        -   `col` increments after printing each number (`row`).
    -   **Printing**:
        
        -   `cout << row << " ";` prints the current value of `row` followed by a space for each iteration of the inner loop.
        -   After printing all numbers for the current `row`, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line to start a new row.
- **Output**:
    
    -   After the execution of the nested loops, the program prints a pattern of numbers where each row contains numbers equal to the row number. For example, the first row prints `1`, the second row prints `2 2`, the third row prints `3 3 3`, and so on up to `N`.

## Example Output (for `N = 4`):

```
Enter the value of N: 4
1 
2 2 
3 3 3 
4 4 4 4
``` 

### Summary:

-   This program takes an integer input `N` from the user.
-   It then prints `N` rows where each row `i` contains `i` copies of the number `i`.
-   The program uses nested while loops to achieve this output, with `row` controlling the number of rows and `col` controlling the number of times each number (`row`) is printed per row.

This code snippet demonstrates basic control flow using loops and input/output operations in C++, and it showcases how to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on user input.
