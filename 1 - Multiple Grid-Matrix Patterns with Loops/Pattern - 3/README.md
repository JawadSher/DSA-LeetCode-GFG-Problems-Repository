Let's break down the C++ code provide in the main.cpp.

## Source Code Explanation

-  **Include Header and Namespace**:

    ```#include <iostream>```
    
   ``` using namespace std;``` 
    
    -   This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which allows input and output operations (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.
-  **Main Function**:
    
    `int main() {
      int N;
      cout << "Enter a value for N: ";
      cin >> N;` 
    
    -   This defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `N` to store user input.
    
-  **Input**:
    
     `cout << "Enter a value for N: ";
      cin >> N;` 
    
    -   Prompts the user to enter a value for `N` and stores it in the variable `N`.
    
-  **Initialization**:

	  ```int row = 1; ```
     
	  ```int num = 1;``` 
    
	  -   `row` and `num` are initialized to 1. `row` is used to track the current row number in the output, and `num` is used to print consecutive numbers starting from 1.
	  
- **Nested While Loop for Output**:

    ```
     while (row <= N) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= N + N) {
          cout << num << " ";
          col++;
          num++;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row++;
      }
     ``` 
    
    -   **Outer Loop (`while (row <= N) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `N` times, once for each row.
        -   `row` starts at 1 and increments after each row is printed.
        
    -   **Inner Loop (`while (col <= N + N) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `N + N` times (or `2N` times) for each row.
        -   `col` starts at 1 and increments after each number (`num`) is printed.
        -   `num` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time a number is printed.
    
    -   **Printing**:
        
        -   `cout << num << " ";` prints the current value of `num` followed by a space.
        -   After printing `2N` numbers (from `1` to `2N`), `endl` is used to move to the next line (`cout << endl;`).

-  **Output**:
    
    -   After the execution of the nested loops, the program prints `N` rows, with each row containing `2N` numbers, incrementing sequentially from 1.

## Example Output (for `N = 3`):

```
Enter a value for N: 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 11 12 
13 14 15 16 17 18
``` 

### Summary:

-   This program takes an integer input `N` from the user.
-   It then prints `N` rows, each containing `2N` numbers sequentially starting from 1.
-   The program uses nested while loops to achieve this output, with `row` controlling the number of rows and `col` controlling the number of columns per row.

This code snippet demonstrates basic control flow using loops and input/output operations in C++, and it showcases how to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on user input.
