## Source Code Explanation

-  **Variable Declaration and Input:**
    
	  ```int N;```
	  ```cout << "Enter the value of N: ";```
	  ``` cin >> N;``` 
    
   - `N` is an integer variable that stores the user input, which represents the number of rows in the pattern.

-  **Outer While Loop (Rows):**
    
    
    ```int row = 1;```
    
    ```while (row <= N) {``` 
    
    -   This loop iterates from `row = 1` to `row = N`, which corresponds to the number of rows in the pattern.
-  **First Inner While Loop (Spaces and Dashes before Numbers):**
   
    
    ```
    int space = 1;
    while (space < N-row+1) {
      cout << "-" << " ";
      space++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   `space` is initialized to 1 and represents the number of spaces to print before the numbers in each row.
    -   This loop prints dashes (`-`) followed by a space. It runs `N - row` times, so the number of dashes printed decreases with each row.
-  **Second Inner While Loop (Numbers in Ascending Order):**
    
    
    ```
    int col = 1;
    while (col <= row) {
      cout << col << " ";
      col++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   `col` is initialized to 1 and represents the column number within each row.
    -   This loop prints numbers starting from 1 up to `row`.
-  **Third Inner While Loop (Numbers in Descending Order):**
    
    
    ```
    int col2 = 1;
    while (col2 < row) {
      cout << row - col2 << " ";
      col2++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   `col2` is initialized to 1 and represents another loop variable.
    -   This loop prints numbers in descending order from `row - 1` down to 1.
-  **Fourth Inner While Loop (Spaces and Dashes after Numbers):**
    
    
    ```int space2 = 1;
    while (space2 <= N-row+1) {
      cout << "-" << " ";
      space2++;
    }
    ``` 
    
    -   `space2` is initialized to 1 and represents the number of spaces to print after the numbers in each row.
    -   This loop prints dashes (`-`) followed by a space. It runs `N - row + 1` times, which is similar to the first loop but for the trailing spaces and dashes.
- **End of Row:**
    
    
    ```
    cout << endl;
    row++;
    ``` 
    
    -   After printing all the dashes, spaces, and numbers for the current row, a newline character (`endl`) is printed to move to the next line.
    -   `row` is incremented to move to the next row.
-  **Return Statement:**
    
    `return 0;` 
    
    -   The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

## Example Output

Let's see what the output looks like for different values of `N`.

### Example 1: N = 3


```
Enter the value of N: 3
- - 1 - - 
- 1 2 1 - 
1 1 2 1 1
``` 

### Example 2: N = 4

```
Enter the value of N: 4
- - - 1 - - - 
- - 1 2 1 - - 
- 1 1 2 1 1 - 
1 1 1 2 2 1 1
``` 

### Summary

-   The outer loop controls the number of rows (`N` rows).
-   There are four inner loops:
    -   The first and fourth loops print dashes (`-`) and spaces before and after the numbers in each row.
    -   The second loop prints numbers in ascending order (`1 to row`).
    -   The third loop prints numbers in descending order (`row-1 to 1`).
-   The pattern printed is a combination of dashes, spaces, and numbers arranged in a specific format determined by the number of rows (`N`).
