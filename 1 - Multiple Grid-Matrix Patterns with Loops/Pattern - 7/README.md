## Source Code Explanation

-  **Include Header and Namespace**:
    
    ```#include <iostream>```
    
    ```using namespace std;``` 
    
    -   This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which provides basic input and output operations (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.
-  **Main Function**:
    
    ```
    int main() {
      int N;
      cout << "Enter the value of N: ";
      cin >> N;
    ``` 
    
    -   This defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `N` to store user input.
- **Input**:
    
     `cout << "Enter the value of N: ";
      cin >> N;` 
    
    -   Prompts the user to enter a value for `N` and stores it in the variable `N`.
- **Initialization**:
    
     `int row = 1;` 
    
    -   Initializes the variable `row` to 1. `row` will track the current row number in the output pattern.
-  **Nested While Loop for Output**:
  
     ```
     while (row <= N) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= row) {
          cout << row + col - 1 << " ";
          col++;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row++;
      }
    ``` 
    
    -   **Outer Loop (`while (row <= N) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `N` times, once for each row from 1 up to `N`.
        -   `row` increments after each row is printed.
    -   **Inner Loop (`while (col <= row) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `row` times for each row, starting from 1 up to the current value of `row`.
        -   `col` increments after printing each number.
   
    -   **Printing**:
        
        -   `cout << row + col - 1 << " ";` prints the value of `row + col - 1` followed by a space for each iteration of the inner loop.
        -   `row + col - 1` calculates the number to print in each position of the current row. For the first column (`col = 1`), it prints `row`, for the second column (`col = 2`), it prints `row + 1`, and so on.
        -   After printing all numbers for the current `row`, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line to start a new row.
-  **Output**:
    
    -   After the execution of the nested loops, the program prints a pattern of numbers where each row `i` contains numbers starting from `row` up to `row + i - 1`.

## Example Output (for `N = 4`):

```
Enter the value of N: 4
1 
2 3 
3 4 5 
4 5 6 7
``` 

### Summary:

-   This program takes an integer input `N` from the user.
-   It then prints `N` rows where each row `i` contains numbers starting from `i` up to `i + (i - 1)`.
-   The program uses nested while loops to achieve this output, with `row` controlling the number of rows, `col` controlling the number of numbers per row, and the expression `row + col - 1` calculating the value to print at each position in the pattern.

This code snippet demonstrates basic control flow using loops and input/output operations in C++, and it showcases how to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on user input.
