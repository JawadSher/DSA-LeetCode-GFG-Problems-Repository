Let's break down and explain the C++ code snippet for you.

## Source Code Explanation
-  **Include Header and Namespace**:
    
    ```#include<iostream>```
    
    ```using namespace std;``` 
    
    -   This includes the `<iostream>` standard library which provides basic input and output operations (`cout`, `cin`). `using namespace std;` allows us to use `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`.
-  **Main Function**:
    
    
    ```
    int main() {
      int n;
      cout << "Enter the value of n : ";
      cin >> n;
    ``` 
    
    -   This defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `n` to store user input.
-  **Input**:
    
    
	  ```cout << "Enter the value of n : ";```
     
	  ```cin >> n;``` 
    
    -   Prompts the user to enter a value for `n` and stores it in the variable `n`.
-  **Initialization**:
    
    
     `int row = 1;` 
    
    -   Initializes the variable `row` to 1. `row` will track the current row number in the output pattern.
-  **Nested While Loop for Output**:
    
    
     ```
     while (row <= n) {
        int col = 1;
        while (col <= row) {
          cout << row - col + 1 << " ";
          col = col + 1;
        }
        cout << endl;
        row = row + 1;
      }
   ``` 
    
    -   **Outer Loop (`while (row <= n) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `n` times, once for each row from 1 up to `n`.
        -   `row` increments after each row is printed.
    -   **Inner Loop (`while (col <= row) { ... }`)**:
        
        -   Executes `row` times for each row, starting from 1 up to the current value of `row`.
        -   `col` increments after printing each number.
    -   **Printing**:
        
        -   `cout << row - col + 1 << " ";` prints the value of `row - col + 1` followed by a space for each iteration of the inner loop.
        -   `row - col + 1` calculates the number to print in each position of the current row. For the first column (`col = 1`), it prints `row`, for the second column (`col = 2`), it prints `row - 1`, and so on, effectively printing numbers in descending order from `row` to `1`.
        -   After printing all numbers for the current `row`, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line to start a new row.
-  **Output**:
    
    -   After the execution of the nested loops, the program prints a pattern of numbers where each row `i` contains numbers in descending order from `i` down to `1`.

## Example Output (for `n = 5`):
```
Enter the value of n : 5
1 
2 1 
3 2 1 
4 3 2 1 
5 4 3 2 1
``` 

### Summary:

-   This program takes an integer input `n` from the user.
-   It then prints `n` rows where each row `i` contains numbers in descending order starting from `i` down to `1`.
-   The program uses nested while loops to achieve this output, with `row` controlling the number of rows, `col` controlling the number of numbers per row, and the expression `row - col + 1` calculating the value to print at each position in the pattern.

This code snippet demonstrates basic control flow using loops and input/output operations in C++, and it showcases how to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on user input.
