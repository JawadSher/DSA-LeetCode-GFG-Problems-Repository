<h1 align='center'>RECURSION - PROBLEMS</h1>

<p align='center'>
Welcome to the 'Recursion Problems' repository! This repository contains a collection of problems that focus on the **Recursion** technique in programming. Recursion is a powerful concept where a function calls itself in order to break down a complex problem into simpler sub-problems.

## About Recursion

Recursion is an essential topic in computer science and algorithm design. It is widely used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems. This repository includes a variety of recursive challenges, such as:

- Finding Fibonacci numbers
- Sorting arrays
- Generating subsets and subsequences
- Searching for elements in arrays
- Solving problems related to paths, combinations, and more!

Each problem in this repository is designed to help you understand and practice recursion, and it provides solutions using this technique. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your recursion knowledge, this collection is sure to enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Problem List

Here you will find a list of problems organized by topic. For each problem, you'll find both **Leetcode** and **GFG** links (where available), along with descriptions and recursive solutions. The problems include topics like **Fibonacci series**, **Subsets generation**, **String manipulations**, **Sorting**, and much more!

Start solving and exploring to dive deep into recursion and improve your coding skills!
