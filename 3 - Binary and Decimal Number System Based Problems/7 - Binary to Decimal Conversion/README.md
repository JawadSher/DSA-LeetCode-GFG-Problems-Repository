## Source Code Explanation

**Header Inclusions:**

-   `<iostream>`: Included for standard input/output operations (like `cout` for printing).
-   `<cmath>` (preferred in C++11 and later): Included for mathematical functions like `pow` (to calculate powers).
-   `<string>`: Not strictly necessary for this code, but it can be included for potential future string manipulation needs.

**`main` Function:**

**Variable Declarations:**

-   `binary`: An integer variable initialized with the negative binary number `-10101` (interpreted as a signed integer).
-   `isNegative`: A boolean variable to track if the input `binary` was negative (optional, see note below).
-   `decimal`: An integer variable to store the final decimal equivalent.
-   `i`: An integer variable used as a counter for the position of digits in the binary number.

**Checking Sign (Optional):**

-   `isNegative = binary < 0;`: This line checks if the `binary` value is negative and stores the result (true or false) in the `isNegative` variable. However, this step might be redundant in some cases (see note below).

**Initialization:**

-   `decimal = 0;`: Initializes the `decimal` variable to 0 to store the final decimal result.
-   `i = 0;`: Initializes the `i` counter to 0, which will keep track of the position of each binary digit.

**Conversion Loop:**

-   `while (binary) { ... }`: This loop iterates as long as `binary` is not zero. During each iteration, a digit is extracted from the binary number and converted to its decimal contribution.
    -   `int digit = binary % 10;`: Extracts the least significant digit (LSD) of the `binary` number using the modulo operator (`%`). Since you're assuming the input is a valid binary number represented as a signed integer, this modulo by 10 will correctly extract the LSD (either 0 or 1).
    -   `if (digit == 1) { decimal += pow(2, i); }`: This `if` statement checks if the extracted digit is 1. If it is:
        -   `pow(2, i)`: Calculates 2 raised to the power of `i` using the `pow` function. The `i` counter represents the position of the digit, so 2 raised to `i` gives the weight (decimal value) of that digit.
        -   `decimal += pow(2, i);`: Adds the calculated weight (contribution) of the current digit (1) to the `decimal` variable.
    -   `binary = binary / 10;`: Right shifts the `binary` value by 1 digit to remove the processed LSD for the next iteration.
    -   `i++;`: Increments the `i` counter to keep track of the position for the next digit.

**Handling Sign (Optional):**

-   `if (isNegative) { decimal = -decimal; }`: This `if` statement negates the final `decimal` value if the original `binary` was negative (based on the `isNegative` flag). However, this step might be redundant in some cases (see note below).

**Output:**

-   `cout << "The Decimal is: " << decimal;`: Prints the message indicating the decimal equivalent along with the calculated `decimal` value.

**Return:**

-   `return 0;`: Indicates successful program termination.

**Key Points:**

-   The code assumes the input `binary` is a valid negative binary number represented as a signed integer.
-   The conversion loop efficiently iterates through the binary digits (extracted using modulo by 10) and calculates their decimal contributions based on their positions (weights using 2 raised to the power of `i`).
-   The `isNegative` check and the final sign handling might be redundant depending on how you interpret the binary input. If you're using a signed integer for `binary`, the sign information is already embedded in the value. However, these steps can be helpful for clarity if you're unsure about the input format or want to explicitly handle positive/negative cases.

**Additional Notes:**

-   Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `binary` (e.g.,  `inputNumber`).
-   You could potentially improve the code by explicitly checking for invalid input (e.g., non-binary digits in the input number).
