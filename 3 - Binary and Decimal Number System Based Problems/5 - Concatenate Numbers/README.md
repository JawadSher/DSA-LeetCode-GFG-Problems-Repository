## Source Code Explanation
1.  **Header Inclusion:**
    
    -   `<iostream>`: This header file is included for input/output operations (like `cin` for user input and `cout` for printing).
2.  **`main` Function:**
    
    -   **Variable Declarations:**
        
        -   `n`: An integer variable to store the value entered by the user in each iteration of the loop.
        -   `range`: An integer variable initialized to 5. It acts as a counter to control the loop and collect values for five iterations (assuming you want to concatenate five numbers).
        -   `ans`: An integer variable initialized to 0. It will store the final concatenated number.
    -   **Loop:**
        
        -   The `while (range)` loop continues as long as `range` is not zero. Since `range` is initially 5, the loop will run five times.
        -   Inside the loop:
            -   `cout << "Enter the value of n: ";`: This line prompts the user to enter an integer value.
            -   `cin >> n;`: This line reads the user's input and stores it in the `n` variable.
            -   `ans = ans * 10 + n;`: This is the key line for concatenation. It does the following:
                -   `ans * 10`: Multiplies the current value of `ans` by 10. This effectively shifts the existing digits in `ans` one place to the left, making space for the new digit to be added.
                -   `+ n`: Adds the newly entered value `n` to the shifted `ans`. This essentially appends `n` to the left side of the existing number in `ans`.
            -   `range--;`: Decrements the `range` counter by 1 to control the number of loop iterations.
    -   **Output:**
        
        -   `cout << "Concatenated Number is: " << ans;`: This line prints a message to the console displaying the final concatenated number stored in `ans`.
    -   **Return:**
        
        -   `return 0;`: This line indicates successful program termination.

## Example Output

If the user enters the following values:

```
Enter the value of n: 1
Enter the value of n: 2
Enter the value of n: 3
Enter the value of n: 4
Enter the value of n: 5

```

The output will be:

```
Concatenated Number is: 12345

```

**Note:**

-   This code assumes the user will enter valid integer values. You could add error handling to check for invalid input.
-   The size of the concatenated number depends on the initial value of `range`. To concatenate a different number of values, you'd need to adjust `range` accordingly.
