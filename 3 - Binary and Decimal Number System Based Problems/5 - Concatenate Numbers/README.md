## Source Code Explanation
1.  **Initialization:**
    
    -   Youâ€™ve declared an integer variable  `ans`  and initialized it to 0. This variable will store the concatenated result.
    -   The  `range`  variable is set to 5, which determines how many numbers you want to input.
2.  **Loop:**
    
    -   The  `while`  loop runs as long as  `range`  is not zero.
    -   Inside the loop:
        -   It prompts the user to enter a value for  `n`.
        -   The input value is read using  `cin`.
        -   The current value of  `ans`  is multiplied by 10 (shifting its digits left) and then added to the input value of  `n`. This effectively concatenates the digits.
        -   The  `range`  is decremented by 1.
3.  **Example Input:**
    
    -   If you input the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the concatenation process would be as follows:
        -   Initially,  `ans`  is 0.
        -   After inputting 1:  `ans = 1`.
        -   After inputting 2:  `ans = 12`.
        -   After inputting 3:  `ans = 123`.
        -   After inputting 4:  `ans = 1234`.
        -   After inputting 5:  `ans = 12345`.
4.  **Final Output:**
    
    -   The program prints the concatenated result, which is 12345.
