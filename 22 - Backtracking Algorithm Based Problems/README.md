## What is Backtracking?
<p>Backtracking is a systematic method for solving constraint satisfaction problems. This repository is a curated collection of coding problems that leverage the <strong>backtracking algorithm</strong> to explore all possible solutions to a problem efficiently. It is designed to guide learners and developers through the core concepts and applications of backtracking with practical examples.</p>

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. When a solution fails to meet the constraints of the problem, the algorithm backtracks and tries another path.

### Key Features of Backtracking:
- Explores all potential solutions.
- Avoids unnecessary computations by discarding invalid paths (pruning).
- Efficient for constraint satisfaction problems like puzzles, games, and optimization tasks.
