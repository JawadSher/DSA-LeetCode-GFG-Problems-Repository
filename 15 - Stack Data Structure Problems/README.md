<h1 align='center'>STACK - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>

<p align='center'>A <b>Stack</b> is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. In simple terms, the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A stack is often compared to a stack of plates, where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be taken off.

### Key Operations of a Stack

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks whether the stack is empty or not.
5. **Size**: Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.

### Real-World Applications of Stacks

- **Function Calls**: The call stack in programming languages is implemented using stacks. When a function is called, its state (parameters, local variables, etc.) is pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its state is popped off the stack.
- **Undo Operations**: Many software applications, such as word processors, use stacks to keep track of changes so that the user can "undo" actions.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used for parsing expressions and evaluating postfix or infix expressions.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Stack is used in algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and solving puzzles (e.g., mazes, Sudoku).

### Implementation of Stacks

Stacks can be implemented using two primary data structures:

1. **Array**: A stack can be implemented using an array, where elements are pushed and popped from the end of the array.
2. **Linked List**: A stack can also be implemented using a linked list, where elements are added and removed from the head of the list.
