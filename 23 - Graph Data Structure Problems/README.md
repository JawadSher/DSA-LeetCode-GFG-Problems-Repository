<h1 align='center'>GRAPH - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>


This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structure and algorithm (DSA) problems from both LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks (GFG). The problems are organized based on various topics, such as Graphs, Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Linked Lists, Trees, and more. Each problem is accompanied by detailed solutions, including the step-by-step explanation and code walkthroughs to help users grasp the underlying concepts.

The main objective of this repository is to serve as a resource for individuals preparing for technical interviews, improving their problem-solving skills, and gaining hands-on experience with common DSA problems. The repository provides links to the solutions available on LeetCode and GFG, making it a valuable reference for anyone looking to practice DSA problems across multiple platforms.

## Key Features:
- **Structured Organization:** Problems are grouped by topics like Graphs, Arrays, Trees, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- **Step-by-Step Solutions:** Each problem comes with a detailed explanation, code, and approach.
- **LeetCode & GFG Links:** Direct links to the problems on LeetCode and GFG (where available).
- **Interview Preparation:** Aiming to help users prepare for coding interviews, competitive programming, and academic learning.
