<h1 align='center'>BINARY - TREE - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>

<p align='center'>A <b>Binary Tree</b> is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is one of the most fundamental structures in computer science, widely used in algorithms, data storage, and computational problems. Binary trees are particularly useful in searching, sorting, and structuring data in an efficient way.
</p>

### Key Concepts:
- **Root Node**: The topmost node in the tree.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes that have no children.
- **Parent and Child Nodes**: A node connected to a child node is the parent of that child.
- **Subtree**: A tree formed by any node and its descendants.
- **Height of Tree**: The number of edges in the longest path from the root node to a leaf.
- **Depth of Tree**: The number of edges from the root to a specific node.
  
### Types of Binary Trees:
1. **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
2. **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have exactly 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
3. **Complete Binary Tree**: Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
4. **Balanced Binary Tree**: The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

### Applications:
- **Search Operations**: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) allow fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Binary trees are frequently traversed using Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals.
- **Heap Structures**: Binary Heaps are a complete binary tree used for efficient priority queues.
- **Expression Parsing**: Binary trees are used to represent mathematical expressions for evaluation.

### Importance in Coding:
Binary trees form the basis of many coding problems related to searching, pathfinding, traversal, and tree construction. They are often used to solve problems like finding the depth or height of the tree, lowest common ancestor, balanced tree checks, and more.

Happy Coding 😊
