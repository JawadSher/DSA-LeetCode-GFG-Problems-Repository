<p align='center'>
Welcome to the 'Merge Sort Problems' repository! This repository contains a collection of problems that focus on the **Merge Sort** algorithm. Merge Sort is a classic **divide-and-conquer** algorithm that is widely used to sort data efficiently in O(n log n) time.

## About Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a well-known algorithm in computer science used to sort arrays and lists. It works by recursively dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. The key advantage of Merge Sort is its predictable O(n log n) time complexity, which makes it more efficient for large datasets compared to other sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.

This repository includes various Merge Sort algorithm challenges, such as:

- Understanding the working of Merge Sort
- Solving problems that require sorting
- Counting inversions using Merge Sort
- Applying Merge Sort in different problem contexts

Each problem in this repository is designed to help you understand and implement the Merge Sort algorithm. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your knowledge of sorting algorithms, this collection will help you gain expertise in applying Merge Sort.

## Problem List

Here you will find a list of problems organized by topic. For each problem, you'll find **Leetcode** and **GFG** links (where available), along with descriptions and solutions.

Start solving and exploring to improve your understanding of Merge Sort and enhance your coding skills!
