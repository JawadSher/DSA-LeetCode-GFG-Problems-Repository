<h1 align='center'>LINEAR - QUEUE - PROBLEMS</h1>

<p align='center'>A <b>Linear Queue</b> is a fundamental data structure in computer science used to store and manage a collection of elements in a specific order. It operates on a **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle, meaning the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. 
</p>

A linear queue is typically used in scenarios like:
- **Scheduling** tasks (e.g., in CPU scheduling).
- **Handling requests** in a server.
- **Buffer management** in data streams.

#### Operations:
- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove the element from the front of the queue.
- **Peek**: View the element at the front without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
- **IsFull**: Check if the queue is full (when using a fixed-size array).

This simple yet powerful structure is widely used in many algorithms, providing an efficient way to manage data that follows the FIFO rule.
