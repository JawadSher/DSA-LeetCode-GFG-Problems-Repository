<h1 align='center'>CIRCULAR - QUEUE - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>

<p align='center'>A <b>Circular Queue</b> is an advanced version of the linear queue. Unlike the linear queue, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, a circular queue connects the last position back to the first position, creating a circular structure. This helps in utilizing space more efficiently, preventing wasted space when elements are dequeued from the front.
</p>

In a circular queue, when the rear pointer reaches the end of the queue, it automatically wraps around to the beginning if there is available space. This makes circular queues particularly useful in situations where the data structure is being used in a continuous loop, like in scheduling tasks, buffering, and resource management systems.

Key operations in a circular queue include:
- **Enqueue**: Adds an element at the rear.
- **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front.
- **Peek**: Returns the front element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
- **IsFull**: Checks if the queue is full.

Circular queues are widely used in scenarios such as:
- CPU scheduling
- Memory management
- Circular buffers for data streaming
