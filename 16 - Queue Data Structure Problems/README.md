<h1 align='center'>QUEUE - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>

<p align='center'>A <b>Qeueu</b> is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed, similar to how people line up at a ticket counter â€” the person who arrives first is the first to be served.

### Key Operations of a Queue

1. **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the back (rear) of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front/Peek**: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks whether the queue is empty or not.
5. **Size**: Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.

### Types of Queues

1. **Simple Queue**: The basic form of a queue, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
2. **Circular Queue**: A queue where the last position is connected back to the first position, forming a circle. This avoids wasted space when the front elements are dequeued but the rear still has space.
3. **Priority Queue**: A queue where each element is assigned a priority. The element with the highest priority is dequeued first, regardless of its position in the queue.
4. **Deque (Double-ended Queue)**: A queue where elements can be added or removed from both the front and the rear.

### Real-World Applications of Queues

- **Order Processing**: In systems like customer support or ticketing, requests are processed in the order they arrive.
- **Task Scheduling**: Operating systems use queues to schedule tasks, especially in multi-tasking environments, where processes are handled in the order they are ready for execution.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: In graph traversal, queues are used in BFS to explore nodes level by level.
- **Printer Queue**: A queue is used to manage print jobs in a printer, where documents are printed in the order they were submitted.

### Implementation of Queues

Queues can be implemented using two primary data structures:

1. **Array**: A queue can be implemented using an array, where elements are added at the end and removed from the front.
2. **Linked List**: A queue can also be implemented using a linked list, where elements are added to the tail and removed from the head.
