<h1 align='center'>BINARY - SEARCH TREE - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>

<p align='center'>
A <b>Binary Search Tree (BST)</b> is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node follows the property:
- The left subtree contains nodes with values less than the nodeâ€™s value.
- The right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the nodeâ€™s value.
BSTs provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making them integral to various computer science applications.
</p>

### Key Concepts:
- **Root Node**: The topmost node in the BST.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes without children.
- **Subtree**: A tree formed by any node and its descendants.
- **Balanced BST**: A BST where the height difference between the left and right subtrees is at most 1.
- **Traversals**: BSTs are traversed using Inorder, Preorder, or Postorder traversals.

### Applications:
1. **Search Operations**: Efficiently search for a value in \(O(\log n)\) time in balanced BSTs.
2. **Range Queries**: Retrieve all keys within a given range.
3. **Inorder Traversal**: Retrieves nodes in sorted order.
4. **Dynamic Sets**: Store and manage dynamic datasets.
