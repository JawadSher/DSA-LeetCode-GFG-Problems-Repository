<h1 align='center'>HASHMAP - DATA STRUCTURE - PROBLEMS</h1>

This repository contains solutions to various problems based on the Hashmap data structure, sourced from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks (GFG). The problems are organized to help you understand and practice Hashmap-related concepts, which are fundamental for many coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.

The problems cover a range of difficulty levels and can be used to deepen your understanding of how Hashmaps work, including concepts like counting frequencies, managing keys and values, and implementing more complex algorithms.
